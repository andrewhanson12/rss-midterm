  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Three MIT payloads will soon hitch a ride to the moon in a step toward establishing a permanent base on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming days, weather permitting, MIT engineers and scientists will send three payloads into space, on a course set for the moon’s south polar region. Scientists believe this area, with its permanently shadowed regions, could host hidden reservoirs of frozen water, which could serve to sustain future lunar settlements and fuel missions beyond the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NASA plans to send astronauts to the moon’s south pole in 2027 as part of the Artemis III mission, which will be the first time humans touch down on the lunar surface since the Apollo era and the first time any human sets foot on its polar region. In advance of that journey, the MIT payloads will provide data about the area that can help prepare Artemis astronauts for navigating the frozen terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payloads include two novel technologies — a small depth-mapping camera and a thumb-sized mini-rover — along with a wafer-thin “record,” etched with the voices of people from around the world speaking in their native languages. All three payloads will be carried by a larger, suitcase-sized rover built by the space contractor Lunar Outpost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the main rover drives around the moon’s surface, exploring the polar terrain, the MIT camera, mounted on the front of the rover, will take the first ever 3D images of the lunar landscape captured from the surface of the Moon using time of flight technology. These images will beam back to Earth, where they can be used to train Artemis astronauts in visual simulations of the polar terrain and can be incorporated into advanced spacesuits with synthetic vision helmets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the mini-rover, dubbed “AstroAnt,” will wheel around the roof of the main rover and take temperature readings to monitor the larger vehicle’s operation. If it’s successful, AstroAnt could work as part of a team of miniature helper bots, performing essential tasks in future missions, such as clearing dust from solar panels and checking for cracks in lunar habitats and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three MIT payloads, along with the Lunar Outpost rover, will launch to the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and touch down in the moon’s south polar region in a lander built by space company Intuitive Machines. The mission as a whole, which includes a variety of other payloads in addition to MIT’s, is named IM-2, for Intuitive Machines’ second trip to the moon. IM-2 aims to identify the presence and amount of water-ice on the moon’s south pole, using a combination of instruments, including an ice drill mounted to the lander, and a robotic “hopper” that will bounce along the surface to search for water in hard-to-reach regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lunar landing, which engineers anticipate will be around noon on March 6, will mark the first time MIT has set active technology on the moon’s surface since the Apollo era, when MIT’s Instrumentation Laboratory, now the independent Draper Laboratory, provided the landmark Apollo Guidance Computer that navigated astronauts to the moon and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers see their part in the new mission, which they’ve named “&lt;a href="https://www.tothemoon.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;To the Moon to Stay&lt;/a&gt;,” as the first of many on the way to establishing a permanent presence on the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is not just to visit the moon but to build a thriving ecosystem that supports humanity’s expansion into space,” says Dava Newman, Apollo Program Professor of Astronautics at MIT, director of the MIT Media Lab, and former NASA deputy administrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institute’s roots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT’s part in the lunar mission is led by the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI), a research collaborative within the Media Lab that aims to enable a “sci-fi future” of space exploration. The SEI, which was founded in 2016 by media arts and sciences alumna Ariel Ekblaw SM ’17, PhD ’20, develops, tests, and deploys futuristic space-grade technologies that are intended to help humans establish sustainable settlements in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2021, SEI and MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro) offered a course,&amp;nbsp;MAS.839/16.893 (Operating in the Lunar Environment), that tasked teams of students to design payloads that meet certain objectives related to NASA’s Artemis missions to the moon. The class was taught by Ekblaw and AeroAstro’s Jeffrey Hoffman, MIT professor of the practice and former NASA astronaut, who helped students test their payload designs in the field, including in remote regions of Norway that resemble the moon’s barren landscape, and in parabolic flights that mimic the moon’s weak gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of that class, Ekblaw and Hoffman chose to further develop two payload designs: a laser-based 3D camera system and the AstroAnt — a tiny, autonomous inspection robot. Both designs grew out of prior work. AstroAnt was originally a side project as part of Ekblaw’s PhD,&amp;nbsp;based on work originally developed by Artem Dementyev in the Media Lab’s Responsive Environments group,&amp;nbsp;while the 3D camera was a PhD focus for AeroAstro alumna Cody Paige ’23, who helped develop and test the camera design and implement VR/XR technology with Newman, in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both designs were fine-tuned, Ekblaw raised funds and established a contract with Lunar Outpost (co-founded by MIT AeroAstro alumnus Forrest Meyen SM ’13, PhD ’17) to pair the payloads with the company’s moon-bound rover.&amp;nbsp;SEI Mission Integrator Sean Auffinger oversaw integration and test efforts, together with Lunar Outpost, to support these payloads for operation in a novel, extreme environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mission has deep MIT roots,” says Ekblaw, who is the principal investigator for the MIT arm of the IM-2 mission, and a visiting scientist at the Media Lab. “This will be historic in that we’ve never landed technology or a rover in this area of the lunar south pole. It’s a really hard place to land — there are big boulders, and deep dust. So, it’s a bold attempt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site of the IM-2 landing is Mons Mouton Plateau — a flat-topped mountain at the moon’s south pole that lies just north of Shackleton Crater, which is a potential landing site for NASA’s Artemis astronauts. After the Intuitive Machines lander touches down, it will effectively open its garage door and let Lunar Outpost’s rover drive out to explore the polar landscape. Once the rover acclimates to its surroundings, it will begin to activate its instruments, including MIT’s 3D camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be the first time we’re using this specific imaging technology on the lunar surface,” notes Paige, who is the current SEI director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera, which will be mounted on the front of the main rover, is designed to shine laser light onto a surface and measure the time it takes for the light to bounce back to the camera. This “time-of-flight” is a measurement of distance, which can also be translated into surface topography, such as the depth of individual craters and crevices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we’re using a laser light, we can look without using sunlight,” Paige explains. “And we don’t know exactly what we’ll find. Some of the things we’re looking for are centimeter-sized holes, in areas that are permanently shadowed or frozen, that might contain water-ice. Those are the kinds of landscapes we’re really excited to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paige expects that the camera will send images back to Earth in next-day data packets, which&amp;nbsp;will be processed by custom software developed by the team’s lead software engineer, Don Derek Haddad, allowing the camera’s science team to analyze the images&amp;nbsp;as the rover traverses the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the camera maps the moon’s surface, AstroAnt — which is smaller and lighter than an airpod case — will deploy from a tiny garage atop the main rover’s roof. The AstroAnt will drive around on magnetic wheels that allow it to stick to the rover’s surface without falling off. To the AstroAnt’s undercarriage, Ekblaw and her team, led by Media Lab graduate student Fangzheng Liu, fixed a thermopile — a small sensor that takes measurements of the main rover’s temperature, which can be used to monitor the vehicle’s thermal performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can test this one AstroAnt on the moon, then we imagine having these really capable, roving swarms that can help astronauts do autonomous repair, inspection, diagnostics, and servicing,” Ekblaw says. “In the future, we could put little windshield wipers on them to help clear dust from solar panels, or put a pounding bar on them to induce tiny vibrations to detect defects in a habitat. There’s a lot of potential once we get to swarm scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes on the moon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third MIT payload that will be affixed to the main rover is dubbed the Humanity United with MIT Art and Nanotechnology in Space, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-humans-project-breaks-down-borders-empowering-global-voices-reach-stars-0508" target="_blank"&gt;HUMANS project&lt;/a&gt;. Led by MIT AeroAstro alumna Maya Nasr ’18, SM ’21, PhD ’23, HUMANS is a 2-inch disc made from a silicon wafer engraved with nanometer-scale etchings using technology provided by MIT.nano. The engravings are inspired by The Golden Record, a phonograph record that was sent into space with NASA’s Voyager probes in 1977. The HUMANS record is engraved with recordings of people from around the world, speaking in their native languages about what space exploration and humanity mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are carrying the hopes, dreams, and stories of people from all backgrounds,” Nasr says. “(It’s a) powerful reminder that space is not the privilege of a few, but the shared legacy of all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Media Lab plans to display the March 6 landing on a screen in the building’s atrium for the public to watch in real-time. Researchers from MIT’s Department of Architecture, led by Associate Professor Skylar Tibbits, have also built a &lt;a href="https://artfinity.mit.edu/event/mission-control" target="_blank"&gt;lunar mission control room&lt;/a&gt; — a circular, architectural space where the engineers will monitor and control the mission’s payloads. If all goes well, the MIT team see the mission as the first step toward putting permanent boots on the surface of the moon, and even beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our return to the Moon is not just about advancing technology — it’s about inspiring the next generation of explorers who are alive today and will travel to the moon in their lifetime,” Ekblaw says. “This historic mission for MIT brings students, staff and faculty together from across the Institute on a foundational mission that will support a future sustainable lunar settlement.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The core of a massive cluster of galaxies appears to be pumping out far more stars than it should. Now researchers at MIT and elsewhere have discovered a key ingredient within the cluster that explains the core’s prolific starburst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08369-x" target="_blank"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the scientists report using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe the Phoenix cluster — a sprawling collection of gravitationally bound galaxies that circle a central massive galaxy some 5.8 billion light years from Earth. The cluster is the largest of its kind that scientists have so far observed. For its size and estimated age, the Phoenix should be what astronomers call “red and dead” — long done with any star formation that is characteristic of younger galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But astronomers previously discovered that the core of the Phoenix cluster appeared surprisingly bright, and the central galaxy seemed to be churning out stars at an extremely vigorous rate. The observations raised a mystery: How was the Phoenix fueling such rapid star formation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In younger galaxies, the “fuel” for forging stars is in the form of extremely cold and dense clouds of interstellar gas. For the much older Phoenix cluster, it was unclear whether the central galaxy could undergo the extreme cooling of gas that would be required to explain its stellar production, or whether cold gas migrated in from other, younger galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the MIT team has gained a much clearer view of the cluster’s core, using JWST’s far-reaching, infrared-measuring capabilities. For the first time, they have been able to map regions within the core where there are pockets of “warm” gas. Astronomers have previously seen hints of both very hot gas, and very cold gas, but nothing in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection of warm gas confirms that the Phoenix cluster is actively cooling and able to generate a huge amount of stellar fuel on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time we have a complete picture of the hot-to-warm-to-cold phase in star formation, which has really never been observed in any galaxy,” says study lead author Michael Reefe, a physics graduate student in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “There is a halo of this intermediate gas everywhere that we can see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question now is, why this system?” adds co-author Michael McDonald, associate professor of physics at MIT. “This huge starburst could be something every cluster goes through at some point, but we’re only seeing it happen currently in one cluster. The other possibility is that there’s something divergent about this system, and the Phoenix went down a path that other systems don’t go. That would be interesting to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot and cold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phoenix cluster was first spotted in 2010 by astronomers using the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica. The cluster comprises about 1,000 galaxies and lies in the constellation Phoenix, after which it is named. Two years later, McDonald led an effort to focus in on Phoenix using multiple telescopes, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/cool-luminous-galaxy-cluster-identified-0815" target="_blank"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the cluster’s central galaxy was extremely bright. The unexpected luminosity was due to a firehose of star formation. He and his colleagues estimated that this central galaxy was turning out stars at a staggering rate of about 1,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous to the Phoenix, the most star-forming galaxy cluster in the universe had about 100 stars per year, and even that was an outlier. The typical number is one-ish,” McDonald says. “The Phoenix is really offset from the rest of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that discovery, scientists have checked in on the cluster from time to time for clues to explain the abnormally high stellar production. They have observed pockets of both ultrahot gas, of about 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, and regions of extremely cold gas, of 10 kelvins, or 10 degrees above absolute zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of very hot gas is no surprise: Most massive galaxies, young and old, host black holes at their cores that emit jets of extremely energetic particles that can continually heat up the galaxy’s gas and dust throughout a galaxy’s lifetime. Only in a galaxy’s early stages does some of this million-degree gas cool dramatically to ultracold temperatures that can then form stars. For the Phoenix cluster’s central galaxy, which should be well past the stage of extreme cooling, the presence of ultracold gas presented a puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question has been: Where did this cold gas come from?” McDonald says. “It’s not a given that hot gas will ever cool, because there could be black hole or supernova feedback. So,&amp;nbsp;there are a few viable options, the simplest being that this cold gas was flung into the center from other nearby galaxies. The other is that this gas somehow is directly cooling from the hot gas in the core.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neon signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the researchers worked under a key assumption: If the Phoenix cluster’s cold, star-forming gas is coming from within the central galaxy, rather than from the surrounding galaxies, the central galaxy should have not only pockets of hot and cold gas, but also gas that’s in a “warm” in-between phase. Detecting such intermediate gas would be like catching the gas in the midst of extreme cooling, serving as proof that the core of the cluster was indeed the source of the cold stellar fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this reasoning, the team sought to detect any warm gas within the Phoenix core. They looked for gas that was somewhere between 10 kelvins and 1 million kelvins. To search for this Goldilocks gas in a system that is 5.8 billion light years away, the researchers looked to JWST, which is capable of observing farther and more clearly than any observatory to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used&amp;nbsp;the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer on JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which enables scientists to map light in the infrared spectrum. In July of 2023, the team focused the instrument on the Phoenix core and collected 12 hours’ worth of infrared images. They looked for a specific wavelength that is emitted when gas — specifically neon gas — undergoes a certain loss of ions. This transition occurs at around 300,000 kelvins, or 540,000 degrees Fahrenheit — a temperature that happens to be within the “warm” range that the researchers looked to detect and map. The team analyzed the images and mapped the locations where warm gas was observed within the central galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This 300,000-degree gas is like a neon sign that’s glowing in a specific wavelength of light, and we could see clumps and filaments of it throughout our entire field of view,” Reefe says. “You could see it everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the extent of warm gas in the core, the team estimates that the central galaxy is undergoing a huge degree of extreme cooling and is generating an amount of ultracold gas each year that is equal to the mass of about 20,000 suns. With that kind of stellar fuel supply, the team says it’s very likely that the central galaxy is indeed generating its own starburst, rather than using fuel from surrounding galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we understand pretty completely what is going on, in terms of what is generating all these stars,” McDonald says. “We don’t understand why. But this new work has opened a new way to observe these systems and understand them better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was funded, in part, by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An electrospray engine applies an electric field to a conductive liquid, generating a high-speed jet of tiny droplets that can propel a spacecraft. These miniature engines are ideal for small satellites called CubeSats that are often used in academic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since electrospray engines utilize propellant more efficiently than the powerful, chemical rockets used on the launchpad, they are better suited for precise, in-orbit maneuvers. The thrust generated by an electrospray emitter is tiny, so electrospray engines typically use an array of emitters that are uniformly operated in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these multiplexed electrospray thrusters are typically made via expensive and time-consuming semiconductor cleanroom fabrication, which limits who can manufacture them and how the devices can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help break down barriers to space research, MIT engineers have demonstrated the first fully 3D-printed, droplet-emitting electrospray engine. Their device, which can be produced rapidly and for a fraction of the cost of traditional thrusters, uses commercially accessible 3D printing materials and techniques. The devices could even be fully made in orbit, as 3D printing is compatible with in-space manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By developing a modular process that combines two 3D printing methods, the researchers overcame the challenges involved in fabricating a complex device comprised of macroscale and microscale components that must work together seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their proof-of-concept thruster comprises 32 electrospray emitters that operate together, generating a stable and uniform flow of propellant. The 3D-printed device generated as much or more thrust than existing droplet-emitting electrospray engines. With this technology, astronauts might quickly print an engine for a satellite without needing to wait for one to be sent up from Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using semiconductor manufacturing doesn’t match up with the idea of low-cost access to space. We want to democratize space hardware. In this work, we are proposing a way to make high-performance hardware with manufacturing techniques that are available to more players,” says Luis Fernando Velásquez-García, a principal research scientist in MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) and senior author of a paper describing the thrusters, which &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202413706" target="_blank"&gt;appears in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the paper by lead author Hyeonseok Kim, an MIT graduate student in mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modular approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An electrospray engine has a reservoir of propellant that flows through microfluidic channels to a series of emitters. An electrostatic field is applied at the tip of each emitter, triggering an electrohydrodynamic effect that shapes the free surface of the liquid into a cone-shaped meniscus that ejects a stream of high-speed charged droplets from its apex, producing thrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emitter tips need to be as sharp as possible to attain the electrohydrodynamic ejection of propellant at a low voltage. The device also requires a complex hydraulic system to store and regulate the flow of liquid, efficiently shuttling propellant through microfluidic channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emitter array is composed of eight emitter modules. Each emitter module contains an array of four individual emitters that must work in unison, forming a larger system of interconnected modules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a one-size-fits-all fabrication approach doesn’t work because these subsystems are at different scales. Our key insight was to blend additive manufacturing methods to achieve the desired outcomes, then come up with a way to interface everything so the parts work together as efficiently as possible,” Velásquez-García says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, the researchers utilized two different types of vat photo polymerization printing (VPP). VPP involves shining light onto a photosensitive resin, which solidifies to form 3D structures with smooth, high-resolution features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers fabricated the emitter modules using a VPP method called two-photon printing. This technique utilizes a highly focused laser beam to solidify resin in a precisely defined area, building a 3D structure one tiny brick, or voxel, at a time. This level of detail enabled them to produce extremely sharp emitter tips and narrow, uniform capillaries to carry propellant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emitter modules are fitted into a rectangular casing called a manifold block, which holds each in place and supplies the emitters with propellant. The manifold block also integrates the emitter modules with the extractor electrode that triggers propellant ejection from the emitter tips when a suitable voltage is applied. Fabricating the larger manifold block using two-photon printing would be infeasible because of the method’s low throughput and limited printing volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers used a technique called digital light processing, which utilizes a chip-sized projector to shine light into the resin, solidifying one layer of the 3D structure at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each technology works very well at a certain scale. Combining them, so they work together to produce one device, lets us take the best of each method,” Velásquez-García says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propelling performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 3D printing the electrospray engine components is only half the battle. The researchers also conducted chemical experiments to ensure the printing materials were compatible with the conductive liquid propellant. If not, the propellant might corrode the engine or cause it to crack, which is undesirable for hardware meant for long-term operation with little to no maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also developed a method to clamp the separate parts together in a way that avoids misalignments which could hamper performance and ensures the device remains watertight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, their 3D-printed prototype was able to generate thrust more efficiently than larger, more expensive chemical rockets and outperformed existing droplet electrospray engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated how adjusting the pressure of propellant and modulating the voltage applied to the engine affected the flow of droplets. Surprisingly, they achieved a wider range of thrust by modulating the voltage. This could eliminate the need for a complex network of pipes, valves, or pressure signals to regulate the flow of liquid, leading to a lighter, cheaper electrospray thruster that is also more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to show that a simpler thruster can achieve better results,” Velásquez-García says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers want to continue exploring the benefits of voltage modulation in future work. They also want to fabricate denser and larger arrays of emitter modules. In addition, they may explore the use of multiple electrodes to decouple the process of triggering of the electrohydrodynamic ejection of propellant from setting up the shape and speed of the emitted jet. In the long run, they also hope to demonstrate a CubeSat that utilizes a fully 3D-printed electrospray engine during its operation and deorbiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by a MathWorks fellowship and the NewSat Project,&amp;nbsp;and was carried out, in part, using&amp;nbsp;MIT.nano facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Rare and mysterious cosmic explosion: Gamma-ray burst or jetted tidal disruption event?</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly energetic explosions in the sky are commonly attributed to gamma-ray bursts. We now understand that these bursts originate from either the merger of two neutron stars or the collapse of a massive star. In these scenarios, a newborn black hole is formed, emitting a jet that travels at nearly the speed of light. When these jets are directed toward Earth, we can observe them from vast distances — sometimes billions of light-years away — due to a relativistic effect known as Doppler boosting. Over the past decade, thousands of such gamma-ray bursts have been detected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since its launch in 2024, the Einstein Probe — an X-ray space telescope developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in partnership with European Space Agency (ESA) and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics — has been scanning the skies looking for energetic explosions, and in April the telescope observed an unusual event designated as EP240408A. Now an international team of astronomers, including Dheeraj Pasham from MIT, Igor Andreoni from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Brendan O’Connor&amp;nbsp;from Carnegie Mellon University, and others have investigated this explosion using a slew of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including NuSTAR, Swift, Gemini, Keck, DECam, VLA, ATCA, and NICER, which was developed in collaboration with MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open-access report of their findings, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ada7f5" target="_blank"&gt;published Jan. 27 in &lt;em&gt;The Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, indicates that the characteristics of this explosion do not match those of typical gamma-ray bursts. Instead, it may represent a rare new class of powerful cosmic explosion — a jetted tidal disruption event, which occurs when a supermassive black hole tears apart a star.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NICER’s ability to steer to pretty much any part of the sky and monitor for weeks has been instrumental in our understanding of these unusual cosmic explosions,” says Pasham, a research scientist at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a jetted tidal disruption event is plausible, the researchers say the lack of radio emissions from this jet is puzzling. O’Connor surmises, “EP240408a ticks some of the boxes for several different kinds of phenomena, but it doesn’t tick all the boxes for anything. In particular, the short duration and high luminosity are hard to explain in other scenarios. The alternative is that we are seeing something entirely new!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Pasham, the Einstein Probe is just beginning to scratch the surface of what seems possible. “I’m excited to chase the next weird explosion from the Einstein Probe”, he says, echoing astronomers worldwide who look forward to the prospect of discovering more unusual explosions from the farthest reaches of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One supermassive black hole has kept astronomers glued to their scopes for the last several years. First came a surprise disappearance, and now, a precarious spinning act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The black hole in question is 1ES 1927+654, which is about as massive as a million suns and sits in a galaxy that is 270 million light-years away. In 2018, astronomers at MIT and elsewhere&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/black-hole-corona-reappear-0716" target="_blank"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that the black hole’s corona — a cloud of whirling, white-hot plasma — suddenly disappeared, before reassembling months later. The brief though dramatic shut-off was a first in black hole astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the MIT team have now caught the same black hole exhibiting more unprecedented behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronomers have detected flashes of X-rays coming from the black hole at a steadily increasing clip. Over a period of two years, the flashes, at millihertz frequencies, increased from every 18 minutes to every seven minutes. This dramatic speed-up in X-rays has not been seen from a black hole until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored a number of scenarios for what might explain the flashes. They believe the most likely culprit is a spinning white dwarf — an extremely compact core of a dead star that is orbiting around the black hole and getting precariously closer to its event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape the black hole’s gravitational pull. If this is the case, the white dwarf must be pulling off an impressive balancing act, as it could be coming right up to the black hole’s edge without actually falling in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would be the closest thing we know of around any black hole,” says Megan Masterson, a graduate student in physics at MIT, who co-led the discovery. “This tells us that objects like white dwarfs may be able to live very close to an event horizon for a relatively extended period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08385-x" target="_blank"&gt;present their findings&lt;/a&gt; today at&amp;nbsp;the 245th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a white dwarf is at the root of the black hole’s mysterious flashing, it would also give off gravitational waves, in a range that would be detectable by next-generation observatories such as the European Space Agency's Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;These new detectors are designed to detect oscillations on the scale of minutes, so this black hole system is in that sweet spot,” says co-author Erin Kara, associate professor of physics at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other co-authors include MIT Kavli members Christos Panagiotou, Joheen Chakraborty, Kevin Burdge, Riccardo Arcodia, Ronald Remillard, and Jingyi Wang, along with collaborators from multiple other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara and Masterson were part of the team that observed 1ES 1927+654 in 2018, as the black hole’s corona went dark, then slowly rebuilt itself over time. For a while, the newly reformed corona — a cloud of highly energetic plasma and X-rays — was the brightest X-ray-emitting object in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was still extremely bright, though it wasn’t doing anything new for a couple years and was kind of gurgling along. But we felt we had to keep monitoring it because it was so beautiful,” Kara says. “Then we noticed something that has never really been seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the team looked through observations of the black hole taken by the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton, a space-based observatory that detects and measures X-ray emissions from black holes, neutron stars, galactic clusters, and other extreme cosmic sources. They noticed that X-rays from the black hole appeared to pulse with increasing frequency. Such “quasi-periodic oscillations” have only been observed in a handful of other supermassive black holes, where X-ray flashes appear with regular frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of&amp;nbsp;1ES 1927+654, the flickering seemed to steadily ramp up, from every 18 minutes to every seven minutes over the span of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never seen this dramatic variability in the rate at which it’s flashing,” Masterson says. “This looked absolutely nothing like a normal supermassive black hole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the flashing was detected in the X-ray band points to the strong possibility that the source is somewhere very close to the black hole. The innermost regions of a black hole are extremely high-energy environments, where X-rays are produced by fast-moving, hot plasma. X-rays are less likely to be seen at farther distances, where gas can circle more slowly in an accretion disk. The cooler environment of the disk can emit optical and ultraviolet light, but rarely gives off X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Seeing something in the X-rays is already telling you you’re pretty close to the black hole,” Kara says. “When you see variability on the timescale of minutes, that’s close to the event horizon, and the first thing your mind goes to is circular motion, and whether something could be orbiting around the black hole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X-ray kick-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever was producing the X-ray flashes was doing so at an extremely close distance from the black hole, which the researchers estimate to be within a few million miles of the event horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masterson and Kara explored models for various astrophysical phenomena that could explain the X-ray patterns that they observed, including a possibility relating to the black hole’s corona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One idea is that this corona is oscillating, maybe blobbing back and forth, and if it starts to shrink, those oscillations get faster as the scales get smaller,” Masterson says. “But we’re in the very early stages of understanding coronal oscillations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another promising scenario, and one that scientists have a better grasp on in terms of the physics involved, has to do with a daredevil of a white dwarf. According to their modeling, the researchers estimate the white dwarf could have been about one-tenth the mass of the sun. In contrast, the supermassive black hole itself is on the order of 1 million solar masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When any object gets this close to a supermassive black hole, gravitational waves are expected to be emitted, dragging the object closer to the black hole. As it circles closer, the white dwarf moves at a faster rate, which can explain the increasing frequency of X-ray oscillations that the team observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf is practically at the precipice of no return and is estimated to be just a few million miles from the event horizon. However, the researchers predict that the star will not fall in. While the black hole’s gravity may pull the white dwarf inward, the star is also shedding part of its outer layer into the black hole. This shedding acts as a small kick-back, such that the white dwarf — an incredibly compact object itself — can resist crossing the black hole’s boundary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because white dwarfs are small and compact, they’re very difficult to shred apart, so they can be very close to a black hole,” Kara says. “If this scenario is correct, this white dwarf is right at the turn around point, and we may see it get further away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to continue observing the system, with existing and future telescopes, to better understand the extreme physics at work in a black hole’s innermost environments. They are particularly excited to study the system once the space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA launches —&amp;nbsp;currently planned for the mid 2030s — as the gravitational waves that the system should give off will be in a sweet spot that LISA can clearly detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The one thing I’ve learned with this source is to never stop looking at it because it will probably teach us something new,” Masterson says. “The next step is just to keep our eyes open.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Monitoring space traffic</title>

  <description><![CDATA[AeroAstro PhD student Sydney Dolan uses an interdisciplinary approach to develop collision-avoidance algorithms for satellites.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If there’s a through line in Sydney Dolan’s pursuits, it’s a fervent belief in being a good steward — both in space and on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a doctoral student in the MIT &lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/dinamo-group/"&gt;Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics&lt;/a&gt; (AeroAstro), Dolan is developing a model that aims to mitigate satellite collisions. They see space as a public good, a resource for everyone. “There’s a real concern that you could be potentially desecrating a whole orbit if enough collisions were to happen,” they say. “We have to be very thoughtful about trying maintain people’s access, to be able to use space for all the different applications that it has today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here on the Blue Planet, Dolan is passionate about building community and ensuring that students in the department have what they need to succeed. To that end, they have been deeply invested in mentoring other students; leading and participating in affinity groups for women and the LGBTQ+ community; and creating communications resources to help students navigate grad school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launching into new territories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan’s interest in aerospace began as a high school student in Centerville, Virginia. A close friend asked them to go to a model rocket club meeting because she didn’t want to go alone. “I ended up going with her and really liking it, and it ended up becoming more of my thing than her kind of thing!” they say with a laugh. Building rockets and launching them in rural Virginia gave Dolan formative, hands-on experience in aerospace engineering and convinced them to pursue the field in college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They attended Purdue University, lured by the beautiful aerospace building and the school’s stature as a leading producer of astronauts. While they’re grateful for the education they received at Purdue, the dearth of other women in the department was glaring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That gender imbalance motivated Dolan to launch Purdue Women in Aerospace, to facilitate connections and work on changing the department’s culture. The group worked to make study spaces more welcoming to women and planned the inaugural Amelia Earhart Summit to celebrate women’s contributions to the field. Several hundred students, alumni, and others gathered for a full day of inspiring speakers, academic and industry panels, and networking opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During their junior year, Dolan was accepted into the Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program, which places students with a commercial space company and pairs them with a career mentor. They interned at Nanoracks over the summer, developing a small cubesat payload that went on the International Space Station. Through the internship they met an MIT AeroAstro PhD alumna, Natalya Bailey ’14.&amp;nbsp;Since Dolan was leaning toward going to graduate school, Bailey provided valuable advice about where to consider applying and what goes into an application package — as well as a plug for MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they applied to other schools, MIT stood out. “At the time, I really wasn’t sure if I wanted to be more in systems engineering or if I wanted to specialize more in guidance, navigation, controls, and autonomy. And I really like that the program at MIT has strength in both of those areas,” Dolan explains, adding that few schools have both specialties. That way, they would always have the option to switch from one to the other if their interests changed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a good space actor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That option would come in handy. For their master’s degree, they conducted two research projects in systems engineering. In their first year, they joined the &lt;a href="https://systems.mit.edu/"&gt;Engineering Systems Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, comparing lunar and Martian mission architectures to identify which technologies could be successfully deployed both on the moon and Mars to, as Dolan says, “get our bang for the buck.” Next, they worked on the Media Lab’s &lt;a name="_Hlk184721248"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/tesserae-self-assembling-space-architecture/overview/"&gt;TESSERAE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;project, which aims to create tiles that can autonomously self-assemble to form science labs, zero-gravity habitats, and other applications in space. Dolan worked on the controls for the tiles and the feasibility of using computer vision for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Dolan decided to switch their focus to autonomy for their PhD, with a focus on satellite traffic applications. They joined the &lt;a name="_Hlk184721294"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/dinamo-group/"&gt;DINaMo Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, working with Hamsa Balakrishnan, associate dean of the School of Engineering and the William Leonhard (1940) Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing space traffic has become increasingly complex. As the cost to get to space decreases and new launch providers like SpaceX have spun up, the number of satellites has grown over the last few decades — as well as the risk of collisions. Traveling at approximately 17,000 miles per hour, satellites can cause catastrophic damage and create debris that, in turn, poses an additional hazard. The European Space Agency has estimated that there are roughly 11,500 satellites in orbit (2,500 of which are not active) and over 35,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimeters. Last February, there was a &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-timed-satellite-russian-space-junk-near-miss-february-2024"&gt;near-collision&lt;/a&gt; — missing by only 33 feet — between a NASA&lt;a name="_Hlk184721396"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;satellite and a non-operational Russian spy satellite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these risks, there’s no centralized governing body monitoring satellite maneuvers, and many operators are reluctant to share their satellite’s exact location, although they will provide limited information, Dolan says. Their doctoral thesis aims to address these issues through a model that enables satellites to independently make decisions on maneuvers to avoid collisions, using information they glean from nearby satellites. Dolan’s approach is interdisciplinary, using reinforcement learning, game theory, and optimal control to abstract a graph representation of the space environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan sees the model as a potential tool that could provide decentralized oversight and inform policy: “I’m&amp;nbsp;largely&amp;nbsp;just&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;favor&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;being&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;good&amp;nbsp;space&amp;nbsp;actor,&amp;nbsp;thinking&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;space&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;protected resource, just like the national parks. And here’s a mathematical tool we can use to really validate that this sort of information would be&amp;nbsp;helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a natural fit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now wrapping up their fifth year, Dolan has been deeply involved in the MIT AeroAstro community since arriving in 2019. They have served as a peer mediator in the &lt;a href="https://aeroastro-refs.mit.edu/"&gt;dREFS&lt;/a&gt; program (Department Resources for Easing Friction and Stress); mentored other women students; and served as co-president of the &lt;a href="https://gwae.mit.edu/"&gt;Graduate Women in Aerospace Engineering&lt;/a&gt; group. As a communication fellow in the &lt;a href="https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/aeroastro/"&gt;AeroAstro Communications Lab&lt;/a&gt;, Dolan has created and offered workshops, coaching, and other resources to help students with journal articles, fellowship applications, posters, resumes,&amp;nbsp;and other forms of science communications. “I just believe so firmly that all people should have the same resources to succeed in grad school,” Dolan says. “MIT does a really great job providing a lot of resources, but sometimes it can be daunting to figure out what they are and who to ask.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, they helped found an LGBTQ+ affinity group called QuASAR (Queer Advocacy Space in AeroAstro). Unlike most MIT clubs, QuASAR is open to everyone in the department — undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff. Members gather several times a year for social events, and QuASAR has hosted academic and industry panels to better reflect the variety of identities in the aerospace field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their spare time Dolan loves ultrarunning — that is, running distances greater than a marathon. To date, they’ve run 50-kilometer and 50-mile races, and recently, a whopping 120 miles in a backyard ultramarathon (“basically, run ’til you drop,” Dolan says). It’s a great antidote to stress, and, curiously, they’ve noticed there are a lot of PhD students in ultrarunning. “I was talking with my advisor about it one time and she’s like, ‘Sydney, you’re crazy, why on Earth would you do anything like that?’ She said this respectfully! And I’m like, ‘Yeah, why would I ever want to do a task that has an ambiguous end date and that requires a lot of work and discipline?’” Dolan says, grinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their hard work and discipline will pay off as they prepare to complete their MIT journey. After wrapping up their degree program, Dolan hopes to land a faculty position at a college or university. Being a professor feels like a natural fit, they say, combining their fascination with aerospace engineering with their passion for teaching and mentoring. As to where they will end up, Dolan waxes philosophical: “I’m throwing a lot of darts at the wall, and we’ll see … it’s with the universe now.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yari Golden-Castaño first learned about the moon, planets, and space while her grandmother in Mexico, Barbarita, taught her how to read from an encyclopedia. Golden-Castaño had already earned the nickname “little astronaut” among her family because of an astronaut onesie that her mother dressed her in. By third grade, she had read a book stating that one needed to be a teacher, a doctor, or an engineer in order to become an astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something was put in my head as a little kid, and I actually wanted it,” says Golden-Castaño. “I didn’t think I could be a doctor, and I didn’t want to be a teacher. I liked to build things and felt like physics and math came easy to me, so I decided I would become an engineer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&amp;nbsp;dream deferred&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although STEM-oriented, Golden-Castaño didn't experience STEM in a hands-on way until eighth grade, when she was selected for the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program. She grew up in a part of Southern California where funding for STEM activities was scarce. Through the GATE program for advanced science students, she saw concepts learned in the classroom come to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everyone understands how things work just by reading a textbook. Personally, I need a visualization. Had I not been selected for this program, I wouldn’t have known that I could be doing these hands-on activities,” she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Golden-Castaño, the GATE program was difficult not because of the STEM concepts covered, but because of the English language barrier. By high school, she was better able to express herself and was excelling in all of her Advanced Placement classes. Yet, when she asked one of her teachers how to become an astronaut, he laughed in her face. “Are you high? What are you taking? You'll never be an engineer or astronaut as a girl,” the teacher said. Other teachers shared his sentiment, pushing Golden-Castaño to attend a liberal arts college and suggesting that she study Spanish — in case she changed her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His response made me feel stupid,” Golden-Castaño says. “In that moment, I decided I would stop telling people that I wanted to be an astronaut one day. I would just go to engineering school and focus on getting my degree. I never once thought about getting out of engineering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission to Mars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in engineering science from Smith College in 2010, Golden-Castaño joined MIT Lincoln Laboratory as a data analyst in a group developing air traffic control systems. At the laboratory, she was surrounded by like-minded individuals who shared her aspiration to journey to space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shortly after I arrived, I heard that NASA had put out a call for astronaut applications, and many of my colleagues were applying,” Golden-Castaño says. “That gave me hope and inspired me to open back up about my dream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, when the Mars One mission to establish the first human colony on the Red Planet was announced, Golden-Castaño jumped at the chance to obtain a one-way ticket there. By 2015, the 200,000 initial applicants had been whittled down to 100: 50 men and 50 women. On the short list of women was Golden-Castaño’s name. (The Mars 100 were eventually supposed to be down-selected to 24 finalists, but the company backing the mission declared bankruptcy in 2019.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supportive laboratory community and excitement surrounding the prospect of venturing to Mars formed the perfect combination for Golden-Castaño to share her passion for space. She started giving talks at schools across Boston, and even in Mexico, about her dream to become an astronaut and her path into engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having the Mars tag gave me a wider platform to reach out,” Golden-Castaño says. “I now had something to share with students. When I saw their reaction — wow, you’re one of us, you’re a girl, and you didn't stop chasing your dreams when someone told you that you weren’t capable — I realized that I had their attention and should do something more than just talk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden-Castaño had engaged in some educational outreach while serving as vice president of Smith College’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE) during her senior year. She ran a four-workshop version of SWE’s annual Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. Though the event went well, she thought that would be her first and last encounter with educational outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really shy. I didn’t want to stand in front of anyone, let alone have them rely on me for information,” Golden-Castaño explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon joining the laboratory, she instead became involved in community outreach, including volunteering at a Boston food pantry, cleaning up the Charles River, and helping local farms prepare their soil for farming. But now that she was a face of the Mars One mission, she felt compelled to get back into educational outreach and tell her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden-Castaño volunteered at an Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day event run by laboratory colleague Damaris Toepel. Within a few years, Golden-Castaño took over running the event and began noticing that the fifth through eighth grade girls were bored with the content and complaining that they had already done these sorts of workshops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their feedback made me realize that these are girls who have access and opportunity; they are the daughters of our engineers, and attend schools where teachers can afford materials for hands-on demos,” Golden-Castaño says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poised for blastoff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disheartened by this realization and remembering her own limited opportunities as a student, Golden-Castaño in May 2017 created a spinoff of this event called Girls Space Day Adventure. With other volunteers, she assembled eight hands-on space-related demonstrations to bring to MIT in collaboration with women in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. To recruit participants, they contacted schools in the Greater Boston area, aiming to reach underserved students (targeting but not limiting to girls) who could easily travel to MIT campus via subway. A coed turnout of around 60 students rotated through the demonstrations. However, recreating that event proved difficult because many of the volunteers subsequently left the laboratory. Small-scale versions of Girls Space Day Adventure have since run onsite and at nearby schools, as the demonstrations were formatted to be presented independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Golden-Castaño began an external eight-week program for second and third graders, called “Mission to Mars.” Each week focuses on a different aspect of what it takes to go to Mars, such as living under the planet’s gravity, designing a suitable habitat, and growing vegetables that can flourish in Martian soil. On the last day, the students don an astronaut suit and navigate an obstacle course as they communicate with their “ground control” partner via walkie-talkie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting Golden-Castaño as these outreach efforts took off was her now-husband, R. Daniel, whom she met through Mars One. He helped her build many of the demonstrations, even before he started working as a contractor in the laboratory’s &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/communication-systems/laser-communications"&gt;Laser Communications Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hosting Girls Space Day Adventure and Mission to Mars, Golden-Castaño had an idea to make outreach more self-sustaining over the long term by having demonstrations ready for volunteers to deploy at different schools. From that idea, the Girls’ Innovation Research Laboratory (&lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/outreach/girl-girls-innovation-research-lab"&gt;G.I.R.L.&lt;/a&gt;) was born at Lincoln Laboratory in 2019. The program sought to create standalone hands-on workshops on diverse STEM topics, encourage disadvantaged girls to take part (though events are coed), and support women or any laboratory staff members willing to volunteer as STEM role models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goals of G.I.R.L. are to inspire girls to innovate technologies that serve our communities and empower them with the skills, knowledge, resources, and confidence to pursue STEM. For me, another goal is to give women the confidence to volunteer and learn a topic that they may be unfamiliar with, and then go teach it,” says Golden-Castaño, who had to step outside her own comfort zone to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A vast space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, G.I.R.L. has hosted about 50 workshops and reached more than 300 students. Staff from the laboratory's Communications and Community &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/outreach"&gt;Outreach&lt;/a&gt; Office have established relationships with several Greater Boston area schools; organizations including Brookview House, Girls Inc., Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and House of Hope; and events such as Science on State Street and the Christa McAuliffe Center STEM Week Open House. G.I.R.L. provides the resources and materials volunteers need for their demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a reservoir of smart women at the lab, and they have knowledge that can be shared. Volunteers can propose demonstrations on topics of their choosing and independently take them to schools or organizations. We now have a full 'menu' of demonstrations that we can run at any time. Having kids access these hands-on activities that I didn't get to experience outside of the GATE program is inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workshops have spanned diverse fields, including programming, mechanical and electrical engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, optics, forensics, planetary science, and chemistry. One workshop, on Scratch programming with a Makey Makey Board (controller board), teaches students how to assemble a circuit and program a musical instrument to play when they touch keys on the board. In an &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/olivia-brown-and-victoria-helus-advocate-ai-literacy"&gt;artificial intelligence-themed workshop&lt;/a&gt;, students play an AI-or-not guessing game and sort items such as candies to mimic how a decision-tree algorithm works. A workshop covering cybersecurity and internet safety teaches students to see the risks of putting personal information online, decrypt messages, physically pick locks, and understand internet protocols. In a workshop on the basics of light, students assemble light-emitting diode (LED) color-mixing crystals and then use light-diffraction glasses to observe how light splits into different colors at various angles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, G.I.R.L. launched a workshop on chemical reactions, in which students make their own color reactions and learn about chemiluminescence. The latest workshop focused on mechanics, with students assembling a mechanical arm out of cardboard by tracing a hand template and using string to move the fingers through a mechanism similar to a puppeteer controlling a marionette’s limbs. Students also attached a strip of LED onto the back of the arm; Golden-Castaño wrote code to make the light change color depending on which finger is curled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Golden-Castaño, one of the most fulfilling parts of G.I.R.L. is capturing the attention of students, especially those who initially seem disinterested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve arrived in many classrooms where the kids are being disrespectful and talking over us,” Golden-Castaño says. “Then, we start the demo, and even the loudest kid is now attentive and asking relevant questions. Watching them engage with the program is rewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep this momentum going, all G.I.R.L. workshops send students home with follow-up links or materials providing additional learning resources. The volunteers also share their academic and career journeys so that students can envision a path forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One important lesson I’ve learned is that kids don’t want to hear you've known from the beginning what you want to be when you grow up and everything has worked out for you,” Golden-Castaño says. “For many students, G.I.R.L. represents their first hands-on experience with STEM or the first time they are hearing they can do STEM. So, I’m always honest with them. I tell them that I didn't have straight As, and it’s not too late for them to start today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the lack of exposure to STEM, some G.I.R.L. participants face a language barrier, which Golden-Castaño knows all too well. Fluent in conversational Spanish but lacking a technical vocabulary in that language, she has been trying on the fly to translate lessons delivered in English into Spanish. Earlier this year, she prepared ahead of time a presentation in Spanish for a chemistry workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To infinity and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years in, the G.I.R.L. program is still going strong, having withstood the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, which necessitated running the workshops virtually and shipping materials like pre-made kits to classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a system that works overall,” she says. “But we’re at a point where I'd like to see another burst of participation from a new set of volunteers coming up with new demonstrations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting the diverse work ongoing at the laboratory across its &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d"&gt;R&amp;amp;D areas&lt;/a&gt;, Golden-Castaño has several future workshop topics in mind: smart fabrics, biochemistry for threat identification, underwater laser communication, rapid prototyping, technology solutions for climate change, and safety with AI. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden-Castaño, in collaboration with the group that led the Girls Space Day Adventure on MIT campus, also has an app idea for matching volunteers to classrooms in a more automated, targeted way. The app would feature profiles of volunteers — stating their STEM background, demonstrations they lead, and scheduling availability — that teachers could scroll through to determine who complements their classroom curriculum. For example, a teacher of an environmental science class may request the volunteer leading a weather station workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“G.I.R.L. has been a really good journey. Thank you to everyone who made it all possible. I’m grateful to have the support of the many volunteers, instructors, my group leaders, and the Outreach Office,” says Golden-Castaño, now part of the laboratory’s &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/systems-engineering"&gt;Systems Engineering Group&lt;/a&gt;, where she focuses on the assembly, integration, and testing of laser communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While keeping an eye out for the next opportunity to pursue her dream of becoming an astronaut, Golden-Castaño considers her work at the laboratory as foundational for future space exploration: “I’m working on technology that could enable future human missions to space.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fast radio bursts are brief and brilliant explosions of radio waves emitted by extremely compact objects such as neutron stars and possibly black holes. These fleeting fireworks last for just a thousandth of a second and can carry an enormous amount of energy — enough to briefly outshine entire galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first fast radio burst (FRB) was discovered in 2007, astronomers have detected thousands of FRBs, whose locations range from within our own galaxy to as far as 8 billion light-years away. Exactly how these cosmic radio flares are launched is a highly contested unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, astronomers at MIT have pinned down the origins of at least one fast radio burst using a novel technique that could do the same for other FRBs. In their new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08297-w" target="_blank"&gt;appearing today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team focused on FRB 20221022A — a previously discovered fast radio burst that was detected from a galaxy about 200 million light-years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team zeroed in further to determine the precise location of the radio signal by analyzing its “scintillation,” similar to how stars twinkle in the night sky. The scientists studied changes in the FRB’s brightness and determined that the burst must have originated from the immediate vicinity of its source, rather than much further out, as some models have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team estimates that FRB 20221022A exploded from a region that is extremely close to a rotating neutron star, 10,000 kilometers away at most. That’s less than the distance between New York and Singapore. At such close range, the burst likely emerged from the neutron star’s magnetosphere — a highly magnetic region immediately surrounding the ultracompact star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings provide the first conclusive evidence that a fast radio burst can originate from the magnetosphere, the highly magnetic environment immediately surrounding an extremely compact object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these environments of neutron stars, the magnetic fields are really at the limits of what the universe can produce,” says lead author Kenzie Nimmo, a postdoc in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “There’s been a lot of debate about whether this bright radio emission could even escape from that extreme plasma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around these highly magnetic neutron stars, also known as magnetars, atoms can’t exist — they would just get torn apart by the magnetic fields,” says Kiyoshi Masui, associate professor of physics at MIT. “The exciting thing here is, we find that the energy stored in those magnetic fields, close to the source, is twisting and reconfiguring such that it can be released as radio waves that we can see halfway across the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include Adam Lanman, Shion Andrew, Daniele Michilli, and Kaitlyn Shin, along with collaborators from multiple institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burst size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detections of fast radio bursts have ramped up in recent years, due to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME). The radio telescope array comprises four large, stationary receivers, each shaped like a half-pipe, that are tuned to detect radio emissions within a range that is highly sensitive to fast radio bursts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, CHIME has detected thousands of FRBs from all over the universe. While scientists generally agree that the bursts arise from extremely compact objects, the exact physics driving the FRBs is unclear. Some models predict that fast radio bursts should come from the turbulent magnetosphere immediately surrounding a compact object, while others predict that the bursts should originate much further out, as part of a shockwave that propagates away from the central object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To distinguish between the two scenarios, and determine where fast radio bursts arise, the team considered scintillation — the effect that occurs when light from a small bright source such as a star, filters through some medium, such as a galaxy’s gas. As the starlight filters through the gas, it bends in ways that make it appear, to a distant observer, as if the star is twinkling. The smaller or the farther away an object is, the more it twinkles. The light from larger or closer objects, such as planets in our own solar system, experience less bending, and therefore do not appear to twinkle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team reasoned that if they could estimate the degree to which an FRB scintillates, they might determine the relative size of the region from where the FRB originated. The smaller the region, the closer in the burst would be to its source, and the more likely it is to have come from a magnetically turbulent environment. The larger the region, the farther the burst would be, giving support to the idea that FRBs stem from far-out shockwaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twinkle pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their idea, the researchers looked to FRB 20221022A, a fast radio burst that was detected by CHIME in 2022. The signal lasts about two milliseconds, and is a relatively run-of-the-mill FRB, in terms of its brightness. However, the team’s collaborators at McGill University found that FRB 20221022A exhibited one standout property: The light from the burst was highly polarized, with the angle of polarization tracing a smooth S-shaped curve.&amp;nbsp; This pattern is interpreted as evidence that the FRB emission site is rotating — a characteristic previously observed in pulsars, which are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see a similar polarization in fast radio bursts was a first, suggesting that the signal may have arisen from the close-in vicinity of a neutron star. The McGill team’s results are reported in a companion paper today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team realized that if FRB 20221022A originated from close to a neutron star, they should be able to prove this, using scintillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, Nimmo and her colleagues analyzed data from CHIME and observed steep variations in brightness that signaled scintillation — in other words, the FRB was twinkling. They confirmed that there is gas somewhere between the telescope and FRB that is bending and filtering the radio waves. The team then determined where this gas could be located, confirming that gas within the FRB’s host galaxy was responsible for some of the scintillation observed. This gas acted as a natural lens, allowing the researchers to zoom in on the FRB site and determine that the burst originated from an extremely small region, estimated to be about 10,000 kilometers wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that the FRB is probably within hundreds of thousands of kilometers from the source,” Nimmo says. “That’s very close. For comparison, we would expect the signal would be more than tens of millions of kilometers away if it originated from a shockwave, and we would see no scintillation at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zooming in to a 10,000-kilometer region, from a distance of 200 million light years, is like being able to measure the width of a DNA helix, which is about 2 nanometers wide, on the surface of the moon,” Masui says. “There’s an amazing range of scales involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s results, combined with the findings from the McGill team, rule out the possibility that FRB 20221022A emerged from the outskirts of a compact object. Instead, the studies prove for the first time that fast radio bursts can originate from very close to a neutron star, in highly chaotic magnetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These bursts are always happening, and CHIME detects several a day,” Masui says. “There may be a lot of diversity in how and where they occur, and this scintillation technique will be really useful in helping to disentangle the various physics that drive these bursts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pattern traced by the polarization angle was so strikingly similar to that seen from pulsars in our own Milky Way Galaxy that there was some initial concern that the source wasn't actually an FRB but a misclassified pulsar,” says Ryan Mckinven, a co-author of the study from McGill University. “Fortunately, these concerns were put to rest with the help of data collected from an optical telescope that confirmed the FRB originated in a galaxy millions of light-years away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polarimetry is one of the few tools we have to probe these distant sources,” Mckinven explains. “This result will likely inspire follow-up studies of similar behavior in other FRBs and prompt theoretical efforts to reconcile the differences in their polarized signals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by various institutions including the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, and the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT Professor Emeritus &lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/hale-bradt/"&gt;Hale Van Dorn Bradt&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’61&amp;nbsp;of Peabody, Massachusetts, formerly of Salem and Belmont, beloved husband of Dorothy A. (Haughey) Bradt, passed away on Thursday, Nov. 14 at Salem Hospital, surrounded by his loving family.&amp;nbsp;He was 93.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bradt, a longtime member of the Department of Physics, worked primarily in X-ray astronomy with NASA rockets and satellites, studying neutron stars and black holes in X-ray binary systems using rocket-based and satellite-based instrumentation. He was the original principal investigator for the All-Sky Monitor instrument on NASA's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_center/universe/rxte.html"&gt;Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (RXTE), which operated from 1996 to 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Much of his research was directed toward determining the precise locations of celestial X-ray sources, most of which were neutron stars or black holes. This made possible investigations of their intrinsic natures at optical, radio, and X-ray wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Hale was the last of the cosmic ray group that converted to X-ray astronomy,” says Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/claude-canizares/"&gt;Claude Canizares&lt;/a&gt;. “He was devoted to undergraduate teaching and, as a postdoc, I benefited personally from his mentoring and guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He shared the Bruno Rossi Prize in High-Energy Astrophysics from the American Astronomical Society in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt earned his PhD at MIT in 1961, working with advisor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/george-clark-dies-0519"&gt;George Clark&lt;/a&gt; in cosmic ray physics, and taught undergraduate courses in physics from 1963 to 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the 1970s, he created the department's undergraduate astrophysics electives 8.282 and 8.284, which are still offered today.&amp;nbsp;He wrote two textbooks based on that material,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astronomy-Methods-Astronomical-Observations-Cambridge/dp/0521535514"&gt;Astronomy Methods&lt;/a&gt;” (2004) and&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astrophysics-Processes-Physics-Astronomical-Phenomena-ebook/dp/B00QIT4E4K/ref=sr_1_1?crid=V55HS7A1RY7B&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.xXKwRREdRKrMBRaN9TlB8r8taCyWVbJu1d0S_-7ylNw.NpbBHqK68tckGCYZrpnqphDWncJxOUvWT8a9jdAskCc&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=astrophysics+processes+bradt&amp;amp;qid=1733168257&amp;amp;sprefix=Astrophysics+Processes%2Caps%2C97&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Astrophysics Processes&lt;/a&gt;” (2008), the latter which earned him the 2010 Chambliss Astronomical Writing Prize of the American Astronomical Society (AAS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Son of a musician and academic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Born&amp;nbsp;on Dec. 7, 1930, to Wilber and Norma Bradt in Colfax, Washington, he was raised in Washington State, as well as Maine, New York City, and Washington, where he graduated from high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His mother was a musician and writer, and his father was a chemistry professor at the University of Maine who served in the Army during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Six weeks after Bradt's father returned home from the war, he took his own life. Hale Bradt was 15. In 1980, Bradt discovered a stack of his father’s personal letters written during the war, which led to a decades-long research project that took him to the Pacific islands where his father served. This culminated with the book trilogy&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wilbers-War-trilogy-American-Familys/dp/099085440X"&gt;Wilber’s War&lt;/a&gt;,” which earned him two silver awards from the IBPA’s&amp;nbsp;Benjamin Franklin and Foreword Reviews’ IndieFAB; he was also an award finalist from National Indie Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt discovered his love of music early; he sang in the Grace Church School choir in fifth and sixth grades, and studied the violin from the age of 8 until he was 21. He studied musicology and composition at Princeton University, where he played in the Princeton Orchestra. He also took weekly lessons in New York City with one of his childhood teachers, Irma Zacharias, who was the mother of MIT professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/obituaries/jerrold-r-zacharias-atomic-physicist-dies.html"&gt;Jerrold Zacharias&lt;/a&gt;. “I did not work at the music courses very hard and thus did poorly,” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the 1960s, at MIT he played with a string quartet that included MIT mathematicians&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=9"&gt;Michael Artin&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/louis-howard-professor-emeritus-mathematics-dies-0713"&gt;Lou Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/arthur-mattuck-professor-emeritus-mathematics-dies-1102"&gt;Arthur Mattuck&lt;/a&gt;. Bradt and his wife, Dottie, also sang with the MIT Chorale Society from about 1961 to 1971, including a 1962 trip to Europe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Well into his 80s, Bradt retained an interest in classical music, both as a violinist and as a singer, performing with diverse amateur choruses, orchestras, and chamber groups. At one point he played with the Belmont Community Orchestra, and sang with the Paul Madore Chorale in Salem.&amp;nbsp;In retirement, he and his wife&amp;nbsp;enjoyed chamber music, opera, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Navy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the summer before his senior year he began Naval training, which is where he discovered a talent for “mathematical-technical stuff,” he said. “I discovered that on quantitative topics, like navigation, I was much more facile than my fellow students. I could picture vector diagrams and gun mechanisms easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He said he&amp;nbsp;came back to Princeton “determined to get a major in physics,” but because that would involve adding a fifth year to his studies, “the dean wisely convinced me to get my degree in music, get my Navy commission, and serve my two years.” He graduated in 1952, trained for the Navy with the Reserve Officer Candidate program, and served in the U.S. Navy as a deck officer and navigator on the USS Diphda cargo ship during the Korean War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He returned to Princeton to work in the Cosmic Ray lab, and then joined MIT as a graduate student in 1955, working in Bruno Rossi’s Cosmic Ray Group as a research assistant. Recalled Bradt, “The group was small, with only a half-dozen faculty and a similar number of students. Sputnik was launched, and the group was soon involved in space experiments with rockets, balloons, and satellites.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The beginnings of celestial X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy took root in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as did the exploration of interplanetary space. Bradt also worked under&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2008/obit-kraushaar-0331"&gt;Bill Kraushaar&lt;/a&gt;, George Clark, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/1995/bridge"&gt;Herbert Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and was soon joined by radio astronomers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991BAAS...23.1489B"&gt;Alan Barrett&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-professor-emeritus-bernard-burke-astrophysics-pioneer-dies-0924"&gt;Bernard Burke&lt;/a&gt;, and theorist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2005/morrison"&gt;Phil Morrison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While working on his&amp;nbsp;PhD thesis on cosmic rays, he took his measuring equipment to an old cement mine in New York State, to study cosmic rays that had enough energy to get through the 30 feet of overhead rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a professor, he studied&amp;nbsp;extensive air showers with gamma-ray primaries (as low-mu showers) on Mt. Chacaltaya in Bolivia, and in 1966, he participated in a rocket experiment that led to a precise celestial location and optical identification of the first stellar X-ray source, Scorpius X-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“X-ray astronomy was sort of a surprise,” said Bradt. “Nobody really predicted that there should be sources of X-rays out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His group studied X-rays originating from the Milky Way Galaxy by using&amp;nbsp;data&amp;nbsp;collected with rockets, balloons, and satellites.&amp;nbsp;In 1967, he collaborated with NASA to design and launch sounding rockets&amp;nbsp;from White Sands Missile Range, which would use specialized instruments to detect X-rays above Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt was a senior participant or a principal investigator for instruments on the NASA X-ray astronomy satellite missions SAS-3 that launched in 1975, HEAO-1 in 1977, and RXTE in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Sky Monitor and RXTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 1980, Bradt and his colleagues at MIT, Goddard&amp;nbsp;Space Flight Center, and the University of California at San Diego began designing a satellite that would measure X-ray bursts&amp;nbsp; and other phenomena on time scales from milliseconds to years. By 1995, the team launched RXTE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Until 2001, Bradt was the principal investigator of RXTE’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/ASM.html"&gt;All Sky Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which scanned vast swaths of the sky during each orbit. When it was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2012/x-ray-timing-explorer-retirement-0313"&gt;decommissioned in 2012&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the RXTE provided a 16-year record of X-ray emissions from various celestial objects, including black holes and neutron stars. The 1969 sounding&amp;nbsp;rocket experiment by Bradt’s group discovered X-ray pulsations from the Crab pulsar, which demonstrated that the X-ray and optical pulses from this distant neutron star arrived almost simultaneously, despite traveling through interstellar space for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He received NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1978 for his contributions to the HEAO-1 mission and shared the 1999 Bruno Rossi Prize of the American Astronomical Society’s High Energy Astrophysics Division for his role with RXTE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Hale's work on precision timing of compact stars, and his role as an instrument PI on NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer played an important part in cultivating the entrepreneurial spirit in MIT's Center for Space Research, now the MIT Kavli Institute,” says &lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/robert-simcoe/"&gt;Rob Simcoe&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the Francis L. Friedman Professor of Physics and director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.space.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Without Bradt’s persistence, the&amp;nbsp;HEAO 1 and RXTE missions may not have launched, recalls&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.space.mit.edu/people/alan-levine/"&gt;Alan Levine&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’76,&amp;nbsp;a principal research scientist at Kavli who was the project scientist for RXTE.&amp;nbsp;“Hale had to skillfully negotiate to have his MIT team join together with a (non-MIT) team that had been competing for the opportunities to provide both experimental hardware and scientific mission guidance,” he says. “The A-3 experiment was eventually carried out as a joint project between MIT under Hale and Harvard/Smithsonian under Herbert (Herb) Gursky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Hale had a strong personality,” recalls Levine. “When he wanted something to be done, he came on strong and it was difficult to refuse.&amp;nbsp;Often it was quicker to do what he wanted rather than to say no, only to be asked several more times and have to make up excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“He was persistent,” agrees former student, Professor Emeritus&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/saul-rappaport/"&gt;Saul Rappaport&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’68. “If he had a suggestion, he never let up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rappaport also recalls Bradt’s exacting nature. For example, for one sounding rocket flight at&amp;nbsp;White Sands Missile Range, “Hale took it upon himself to be involved in every aspect of the rocket payload, including parts of it that were built by Goddard Space Flight Center — I think this annoyed&amp;nbsp;the folks at GSFC,” recalls Rappaport. “He would be checking everything three times. There was a famous scene where he stuck his ear in the (compressed-air) jet to make sure that it went off, and there was a huge blast of air that he wasn’t quite expecting. It scared the hell out of everybody, and the Goddard people were, you know, a bit amused. The point is that he didn’t trust anything unless he could verify it himself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supportive advisor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Many former students recalled Hale’s supportive teaching style, which included&amp;nbsp;inviting MIT students over to their Belmont home, and was a strong advocate for his students’ professional development.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“He was a wonderful mentor: kind, generous, and encouraging,” recalls physics department head Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/deepto-chakrabarty/"&gt;Deepto Chakrabarty&lt;/a&gt; ’88, who had Bradt as his postdoctoral advisor when he returned to MIT in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’m so grateful to have had the chance to work with Hale as an undergraduate,” recalls University of California at Los Angeles professor and Nobel laureate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/andrea-ghez-shares-2020-nobel-prize-physics-1006"&gt;Andrea Ghez&lt;/a&gt; ’87. “He taught me so much about high-energy astrophysics,&amp;nbsp;the research world, and how to be a good mentor.&amp;nbsp;Over the years, he continuously gave me new opportunities — starting with working on onboard data acquisition and data analysis modes for the future Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer with Ed Morgan and Al Levine. Later, he introduced me to a project to do optical identification of X-ray sources, which began with observing with the MIT-Michigan-Dartmouth Telescope (MDM) with then-postdoc Meg Urry and him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt was a relatively new professor when he became Saul Rappaport’s advisor in 1963. At the time, MIT researchers were switching from the study of cosmic rays to the new field of X-ray astronomy. “Hale turned the whole rocket program over to me as a&amp;nbsp;relatively newly minted PhD, which was great for my career, and he went on to some satellite business, the SAS 3 satellite in particular. He was very good in terms of looking out for the careers of junior scientists with whom he was associated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt looked back on his legacy at MIT physics with pride. “Today, the astrophysics division of the department is a thriving community of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students,” Bradt said recently. “I cast my lot with X-ray astronomy in 1966 and had a wonderfully exciting time observing the X-ray sky from space until my retirement in 2001.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After retirement, Bradt served for 16 years as academic advisor for MIT’s McCormick Hall first-year students. He received MIT's Buechner Teaching Prize in Physics in 1990, Outstanding Freshman Advisor of the Year Award in 2004, and the Alan J. Lazarus (1953) Excellence in Advising Award in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Recalls Ghez,&amp;nbsp;“He was a remarkable and generous mentor and helped me understand the importance of helping undergraduates make the transition from the classroom to the wonderfully enriching world of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Post-retirement, Bradt transitioned into department historian and mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I arrived at MIT in 2003, and it was several years before I realized that Hale had actually retired two years earlier — he was frequently around, and always happy to talk with young researchers,” says Simcoe. “In his later years, Hale became an unofficial historian for CSR and MKI, providing firsthand accounts of important events and people central to MIT's contribution to the ‘space race’ of the mid-20th century, and explaining how we evolved into a major center for research and education in spaceflight and astrophysics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt’s other recognitions include earning a 2015 Darius and Susan Anderson Distinguished Service Award of the Institute of Governmental Studies, a 1978 NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal, and being named a 1972 American Physical Society Fellow and 2020 AAS Legacy Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bradt served as secretary-treasurer (1973–75) and chair (1981) of the AAS High Energy Astrophysics Division, and on the National Academy of Science’s Committee for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics from 1979 to 1982.&amp;nbsp;He recruited many of his colleagues and students to help him host the 1989 meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Boston, a major astronomy conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The son of the late Lt. Col. Wilber E. Bradt and Norma Sparlin Bourjaily, and brother of the late Valerie Hymes of Annapolis, Maryland, he is survived by his wife, Dorothy Haughey Bradt, whom he married in 1958; two daughters and their husbands, Elizabeth Bradt and J. Bartlett “Bart” Hoskins of Salem, and Dorothy and Bart McCrum of Buxton, Maine; two grandchildren, Benjamin and Rebecca Hoskins; two other sisters, Abigail Campi of St. Michael’s, Maryland, and Dale Anne Bourjaily of the Netherlands, and 10 nieces and nephews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Salem Athenaeum, or the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/support-physics/donor-profiles/hale-bradt/"&gt;Thomas Fellowship.&lt;/a&gt; Hale established the Thomas Fellowship in memory of Barbara E. Thomas, who was the Department of Physics undergraduate administrator from 1931 to 1965, as well as to honor the support staff who have contributed to the department's teaching and research programs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MIT has provided a wonderful environment for me to teach and to carry out research,” said Bradt. “I am exceptionally grateful for that and happy to be in a position to give back.” He added, “Besides, I am told you cannot take it with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Barbara E. Thomas Fund in support of physics graduate students has been established in the Department of Physics.

  <title>Liquid on Mars was not necessarily all water</title>

  <description><![CDATA[New study proposes that some of the minerals seen on Mars today may have formed in liquid CO2 instead of water.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dry river channels and lake beds on Mars point to the long-ago presence of a liquid on the planet's surface, and the minerals observed from orbit and from landers seem to many to prove that the liquid was ordinary water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Not so fast, the authors of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01576-1" target="_blank"&gt;a new Perspectives article in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Geoscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest. Water is only one of two possible liquids under what are thought to be the conditions present on ancient Mars. The other is liquid carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and it may actually have been easier for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere to condense into a liquid under those conditions than for water ice to melt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While others have suggested that liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) might be the source of some of the river channels seen on Mars, the mineral evidence has seemed to point uniquely to water. However, the new paper cites recent studies of carbon sequestration, the process of burying liquefied CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recovered from Earth’s atmosphere deep in underground caverns, which show that similar mineral alteration can occur in liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as in water, sometimes even more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new paper is led by Michael Hecht, principal investigator of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-oxygen-generating-experiment-moxie-completes-mars-mission/"&gt;MOXIE instrument&lt;/a&gt; aboard the NASA Mars Rover Perseverance. Hecht, a research scientist at MIT's &lt;a href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu"&gt;Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and a former associate director, says, “Understanding how sufficient liquid water was able to flow on early Mars to explain the morphology and mineralogy we see today is probably the greatest unsettled question of Mars science. There is likely no one right answer, and we are merely suggesting another possible piece of the puzzle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the paper, the authors discuss the compatibility of their proposal with current knowledge of Martian atmospheric content and implications for Mars surface mineralogy. They also explore the latest carbon sequestration research and conclude that “LCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–mineral reactions are consistent with the predominant Mars alteration products: carbonates, phyllosilicates, and sulfates.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The argument for the probable existence of liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Martian surface is not an all-or-nothing scenario; either liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, liquid water, or a combination may have brought about such geomorphological and mineralogical evidence for a liquid Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Three plausible cases for liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Martian surface are proposed and discussed: stable surface liquid, basal melting under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ice, and subsurface reservoirs. The likelihood of each depends on the actual inventory of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the time, as well as the temperature conditions on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The authors acknowledge that the tested sequestration conditions, where the liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is above room temperature at pressures of tens of atmospheres, are very different from the cold, relatively low-pressure conditions that might have produced liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;on early Mars. They call for further laboratory investigations under more realistic conditions&amp;nbsp;to test whether the same chemical reactions occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hecht explains, “It’s difficult to say how likely it is that this speculation about early Mars is actually true. What we can say, and we are saying, is that the likelihood is high enough that the possibility should not be ignored.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In April 2019, a group of astronomers from around the globe stunned the world when they revealed the first image of a black hole — the monstrous accumulation of collapsed stars and gas that lets nothing escape, not even light. The image, which was of the black hole that sits at the core of a galaxy called Messier 87 (M87), revealed glowing gas around the center of the black hole. In March 2021, the same team produced yet another stunning image that showed the polarization of light around the black hole, revealing its magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "camera" that took both images is the &lt;a href="https://eventhorizontelescope.org/"&gt;Event Horizon Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (EHT), which is not one singular instrument but rather a collection of radio telescopes situated around the globe that work together to create high-resolution images by combining data from each individual telescope. Now, scientists are looking to extend the EHT into space to get an even sharper look at M87's black hole. But producing the sharpest images in the history of astronomy presents a challenge: transmitting the telescope's massive dataset back to Earth for processing. A small but powerful laser communications (lasercom) payload developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory operates at the high data rates needed to image the aspects of interest of the black hole. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extending baseline distances into space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EHT created the two existing images of M87's&amp;nbsp;black hole via interferometry — specifically, very long-baseline interferometry. Interferometry works by collecting light in the form of radio waves simultaneously with multiple telescopes in separate places on the globe and then comparing the phase difference of the radio waves at the various locations in order to pinpoint the direction of the source. By taking measurements with different combinations of the telescopes around the planet, the EHT collaboration — which included staff members at the &lt;a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/"&gt;Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; (CfA) and &lt;a href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt; — essentially created an Earth-sized telescope in order to image the incredibly faint black hole 55 million light-years away from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With interferometry, the bigger the telescope, the better the resolution of the image. Therefore, in order to focus in on even finer characteristics of these black holes, a bigger instrument is needed. Details that astronomers hope to resolve include the turbulence of the gas falling into a black hole (which drives the accumulation of matter onto the black hole through a process called accretion) and a black hole's shadow (which could be used to help pin down where the jet coming from M87 is drawing its energy from). The ultimate goal is to observe a photon ring (the place where light orbits closest before escaping) around the black hole. Capturing an image of the photon ring would enable scientists to put Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Earth-based telescopes, the farthest that two telescopes could be from one another is on opposite sides of the Earth, or about 13,000 kilometers apart. In addition to this maximum baseline distance, Earth-based instruments are limited by the atmosphere, which makes observing shorter wavelengths difficult. Earth's atmospheric limitations can be overcome by extending the EHT's baselines and putting at least one of the telescopes in space, which is exactly what the proposed CfA-led &lt;a href="https://www.blackholeexplorer.org/"&gt;Black Hole Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (BHEX) mission aims to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant challenges that comes with this space-based concept is transfer of information. The dataset to produce the first EHT image was so massive (totaling 4 petabytes) that the data had to be put on disks and shipped to a facility for processing. Gathering information from a telescope in orbit would be even more difficult; the team would need a system that can downlink data from the space telescope to Earth at approximately 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) in order to image the desired aspects of the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter TBIRD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is where Lincoln Laboratory comes in. In May 2023, the laboratory's TeraByte InfraRed Delivery (TBIRD) lasercom payload achieved the fastest data transfer from space, transmitting at a rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/ames/nasa-partners-achieve-fastest-space-to-ground-laser-comms-link/"&gt;200 Gbps&lt;/a&gt; — which is 1,000 times faster than typical satellite communication systems — from low Earth orbit (LEO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We developed a novel technology for high-volume data transport from space to ground," says Jade Wang, assistant leader of the laboratory's &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/communication-systems/optical-and-quantum-communications"&gt;Optical and Quantum Communications Group&lt;/a&gt;. "In the process of developing that technology, we looked for collaborations and other potential follow-on missions that could leverage this unprecedented data capability. The BHEX is one such mission. These high data rates will enable scientists to image the photon ring structure of a black hole for the first time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lasercom team led by Wang, in partnership with the CfA, is developing the long-distance, high-rate downlink needed for the BHEX mission in middle Earth orbit (MEO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Laser communications is completely upending our expectations for what astrophysical discoveries are possible from space," says CfA astrophysicist Michael Johnson, principal investigator for the BHEX mission. "In the next decade, this incredible new technology will bring us to the edge of a black hole, creating a window into the region where our current understanding of physics breaks down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though TBIRD is incredibly powerful, the technology needs some modifications to support the higher orbit that BHEX requires for its science mission. The small TBIRD payload (CubeSat) will be upgraded to a larger aperture size and higher transmit power. In addition, the TBIRD automatic request protocol — the error-control mechanism for ensuring data make it to Earth without loss due to atmospheric effects — will be adjusted to account for the longer round-trip times that come with a mission in MEO. Finally, the TBIRD LEO "buffer and burst" architecture for data delivery will shift to a streaming approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With TBIRD and other lasercom missions, we have demonstrated that the lasercom technology for such an impactful science mission is available today," Wang says. "Having the opportunity to contribute to an area of really interesting scientific discovery is an exciting prospect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BHEX mission concept has been in development since 2019. Technical and concept studies for BHEX have been supported by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the Internal Research and Development program at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the University of Arizona, and the ULVAC-Hayashi Seed Fund from the MIT-Japan Program at MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives. BHEX studies of lasercom have been supported by Fred Ehrsam and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When we gaze at nature’s remarkable phenomena, we might feel a mix of awe, curiosity, and determination to understand what we are looking at. That is certainly a common response for MIT’s Alan Lightman, a trained physicist and prolific author of books about physics, science, and our understanding of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of my favorite quotes from Einstein is to the effect that the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious,” Lightman says. “It’s the fundamental emotion that is the cradle of true art and true science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightman explores those concepts in his latest book, “The Miraculous from the Material,” published today by Penguin Random House. In it, Lightman has penned 35 essays about scientific understanding, each following photos of spectacular natural phenomena, from spider webs to sunsets, and from galaxies to hummingbirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightman, who is a professor of the practice of the humanities at MIT, calls himself a “spiritual materialist,” who finds wonder in the world while grounding his grasp of nature in scientific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the material and scientific underpinnings of these spectacular phenomena hasn’t diminished my awe and amazement one iota,” Lightman writes in the book. &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt; talked to Lightman about a handful of the book’s chapters, and the relationship between seeing and scientific curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aurora borealis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, many people ventured outside for a glimpse of the aurora borealis, or northern lights, the brilliant phenomenon caused by solar storms. Auroras occur when unusually large amounts of electrons from the sun energize oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the upper atmosphere. The Earth’s magnetic field creates the folding shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among much else, the aurora borealis — and aurora australis, in southern latitudes — are a testament to the way unusual things fire our curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we respond emotionally as well as intellectually, with appreciation and plain old awe at nature,” Lightman says. “If we go back to the earliest times when people were thinking scientifically, the emotional connection to the natural world was probably as important as the intellectual connection. The wonder and curiosity stimulated by the night sky makes us want to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “The aurora borealis is certainly very striking and makes us aware that we’re part of the cosmos; we’re not just living in the world of tables, and chairs, and houses. It does give us a cosmic sense of being on a planet out in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galileo coined the term “aurora borealis,” referring to the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek god of the north wind. People have created many suggestive accounts of the northern lights. As Lightman notes in the book, the Native American Cree regarded the lights as dead spirits in the sky; the Algonquin people saw them as a fire made by their creator; the Inuit tribes regarded the lights as spirits playing; and to the Vikings, the lights were a reflection off the armor of the Valkyries. It wasn’t until the 1900s that geomagnetic sunstorms were proposed as an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's all a search for meaning and understanding,” Lightman says. “Before we had modern science, we still wanted meaning, so we constructed these mythologies. And then as we developed science we had other tools. But the nonscientific accounts were also trying to explain this strange cosmos we find ourselves in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fall foliage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aurora borealis is unearthly; fall leaves and their colors are literally a down-to-earth matter. Still, Lightman says, while the&amp;nbsp;aurora borealis “is more exotic,” fall foliage can also leave us gazing in wonder. In his book, he constructs a multilayered explanation of the subject, ranging from the chemical compounds in leaves to the properties of color to the mechanics of planetary motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the leaves. The fall hues come from chemical compounds in leaves called carotenoids (which produce yellow and orange colors) and anthocyanins (which create red hues). Those effects are usually hidden because of the presence of chlorophyll, which helps plants absorb sunlight and store energy, and gives off a green hue. But less sunlight in the fall means less chlorophyll at work in plants, so green leaves turn yellow, orange, or red.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To jump ahead, there are seasons because the Earth does not rotate on a vertical axis relative to the plane of its path around the sun. It tilts at about 23.5 degrees, so different parts of the planet receive differing amounts of sunlight during a yearlong revolution around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tilt stems from cosmic collisions billions of years ago. Solar systems are formed from rotating clouds of gas and dust, with planets and moons condensing due to gravity. The Earth likely got knocked off its vertical axis when loose matter slammed into it, which has happened to most planets: In our solar system, only Mercury has almost no tilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightman muses, “I think there’s a kind of poetry in understanding that beautiful fall foliage was caused in part by a cosmic accident 4 billion years ago. That’s poetic and mind-blowing at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandarinfish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can seem astonishing to behold the mandarinfish, a native of the Pacific Ocean that sports bright color patterns only a bit less intricate than an ikat rug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what appears nearly miraculous can also be highly explainable in material terms. There are evolutionary advantages from brilliant coloration, something many scientists have recognized, from Charles Darwin to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a number of living organisms in the book that have striking features,” Lightman says. “I think scientists agree that most features of living organisms have&amp;nbsp; some survival benefits, or are byproducts of features that once had survival benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unusual coloration may serve as camouflage, help attract mates, or warn off predators. In this case, the mandarinfish is toxic and its spectacular coat helps remind its main predator, the scorpionfish, that the wrong snack comes with unfortunate consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For mandarinfish it’s related to the fact that it’s poisonous,” Lightman says. Here, the sense of wonder we may feel comes attached to a scientific mechanism: In a food chain, what is spectacular can be highly functional as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paramecia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paramecia&lt;/em&gt; are single-celled microorganisms that propel themselves thanks to thousands of tiny cilia, or hairs, which move back and forth like oars. People first observed &lt;em&gt;paramecia&lt;/em&gt; after the development of the microscope in the 1600s; they may have been first seen by the Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I judged that some of these little creatures were about a thousand times smaller than the smallest ones I have ever yet seen upon the rind of cheese,” van Leeuwenhoek wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first microscopes in the 17th century uncovered an entire universe at a tiny scale,” Lightman observes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look at a picture of a &lt;em&gt;paramecium&lt;/em&gt;, then, we are partly observing our own ingenuity. However, Lightman is most focused on &lt;em&gt;paramecia&lt;/em&gt; as an evolutionary advance. In the book, he underscores the emerging sophistication represented by their arrival 600 million years ago, processing significant amounts of energy and applying it to motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What interested me about the &lt;em&gt;paramecium&lt;/em&gt; is not only that it was one of the first microorganisms discovered,” Lightman says, “but the mechanisms of its locomotion, the little cilia that wave back and forth and can propel it at relatively great speed. That was a big landmark in evolution. It requires energy, and a mechanical system, all developed by natural selection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “One beautiful thought that comes out of that is the commonality of all living things on the planet. We’re all related, in a very profound way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rings of Saturn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Lightman looked at the rings of Saturn, which are about 1,000 in number, he was at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, using a telescope in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw the rings of Saturn and I was totally blown away because they’re so perfect,” Lightman says. “I just couldn’t believe there was that kind of construction of such a huge scale. That sense of amazement has stayed with me. They are a visually stunning natural phenomenon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rings are statistically stunning, too. The width of the rings is about 240,000 miles, roughly the same as the distance from the Earth to the moon. But the thickness of the rings is only about that of a football field. “That’s a pretty big ratio between diameter and thickness,” Lightman says. The mass of the rings is just 1/50 of 1 percent of our moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely, the rings were formed from matter by a moon that approached Saturn — which has 146 known moons — but got ripped apart, its material scattering into the rings. Over time, gravity pulled the rings into their circular shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The roundness of planets, the circularity of planetary rings, and so many other beautiful phenomena follow naturally from the laws of physics,” Lightman writes in the book. “Which are themselves beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, he has been able to look many times at the rings of Saturn, always regarding it as a “natural miracle” to behold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time you see them, you are amazed by it,” Lightman says. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tiny grains from a distant asteroid are revealing clues to the magnetic forces that shaped the far reaches of the solar system over 4.6 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at MIT and elsewhere have analyzed particles of the asteroid Ryugu, which were collected by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission and brought back to Earth in 2020. Scientists believe Ryugu formed on the outskirts of the early solar system before migrating in toward the asteroid belt, eventually settling into an orbit between Earth and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed Ryugu’s particles for signs of any ancient magnetic field that might have been present when the asteroid first took shape. Their results suggest that if there was a magnetic field, it would have been very weak. At most, such a field would have been about 15 microtesla. (The Earth’s own magnetic field today is around 50 microtesla.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the scientists estimate that such a low-grade field intensity would have been enough to pull together primordial gas and dust to form the outer solar system’s asteroids and potentially play a role in giant planet formation, from Jupiter to Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s results, which are &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024AV001396" target="_blank"&gt;published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;AGU Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, show for the first time that the distal solar system likely harbored a weak magnetic field. Scientists have known that a magnetic field shaped the inner solar system, where Earth and the terrestrial planets were formed. But it was unclear whether such a magnetic influence extended into more remote regions, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re showing that, everywhere we look now, there was some sort of magnetic field that was responsible for bringing mass to where the sun and planets were forming,” says study author Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. “That now applies to the outer solar system planets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author is Elias Mansbach PhD ’24, who is now a postdoc at Cambridge University. MIT co-authors include Eduardo Lima, Saverio Cambioni, and Jodie Ream, along with Michael Sowell and Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech, Roger Fu of Harvard University, Xue-Ning Bai of Tsinghua University, Chisato Anai and Atsuko Kobayashi of the Kochi Advanced Marine Core Research Institute, and Hironori Hidaka of Tokyo Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A far-off field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system formed from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust, which collapsed into a swirling disk of matter. Most of this material gravitated toward the center of the disk to form the sun. The remaining bits formed a solar nebula of swirling, ionized gas. Scientists suspect that interactions between the newly formed sun and the ionized disk generated a magnetic field that threaded through the nebula, helping to drive accretion and pull matter inward to form the planets, asteroids, and moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This nebular field disappeared around 3 to 4 million years after the solar system’s formation, and we are fascinated with how it played a role in early planetary formation,” Mansbach says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists previously determined that a magnetic field was present throughout the inner solar system — a region that spanned from the sun to about 7 astronomical units (AU), out to where Jupiter is today. (One AU is the distance between the sun and the Earth.) The intensity of this inner nebular field was somewhere between 50 to 200 microtesla, and it likely influenced the formation of the inner terrestrial planets. Such estimates of the early magnetic field are based on meteorites that landed on Earth and are thought to have originated in the inner nebula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But how far this magnetic field extended, and what role it played in more distal regions, is still uncertain because there haven’t been many samples that could tell us about the outer solar system,” Mansbach says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewinding the tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team got an opportunity to analyze samples from the outer solar system with Ryugu, an asteroid that is thought to have formed in the early outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, and was eventually brought into orbit near the Earth. In December 2020, JAXA’s Hayabusa2 mission returned samples of the asteroid to Earth, giving scientists a first look at a potential relic of the early distal solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acquired several grains of the returned samples, each about a millimeter in size. They placed the particles in a magnetometer — an instrument in Weiss’ lab that measures the strength and direction of a sample’s magnetization. They then applied an alternating magnetic field to progressively demagnetize each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like a tape recorder, we are slowly rewinding the sample’s magnetic record,” Mansbach explains. “We then look for consistent trends that tell us if it formed in a magnetic field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They determined that the samples held no clear sign of a preserved magnetic field. This suggests that either there was no nebular field present in the outer solar system where the asteroid first formed, or the field was so weak that it was not recorded in the asteroid’s grains. If the latter is the case, the team estimates such a weak field would have been no more than 15 microtesla in intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also reexamined data from previously studied meteorites. They specifically looked at “ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites” — meteorites that have properties that are characteristic of having formed in the distal solar system. Scientists had estimated the samples were not old enough to have formed before the solar nebula disappeared. Any magnetic field record the samples contain, then, would not reflect the nebular field. But Mansbach and his colleagues decided to take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We reanalyzed the ages of these samples and found they are closer to the start of the solar system than previously thought,” Mansbach says. “We think these samples formed in this distal, outer region. And one of these samples does actually have a positive field detection of about 5 microtesla, which is consistent with an upper limit of 15 microtesla.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This updated sample, combined with the new Ryugu particles, suggest that the outer solar system, beyond 7 AU, hosted a very weak magnetic field, that was nevertheless strong enough to pull matter in from the outskirts to eventually form the outer planetary bodies, from Jupiter to Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re further from the sun, a weak magnetic field goes a long way,” Weiss notes. “It was predicted that it doesn’t need to be that strong out there, and that’s what we’re seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to look for more evidence of distal nebular fields with samples from another far-off asteroid, Bennu, which were delivered to Earth in September 2023 by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bennu looks a lot like Ryugu, and we’re&amp;nbsp;eagerly awaiting first results from those samples,” Mansbach says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface — a momentous engineering and science feat marked by his iconic words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." Three years later, Apollo 17 became NASA's final Apollo mission to land humans on the brightest and largest object in our night sky. Since then, no humans have visited the moon or traveled past low Earth orbit (LEO), largely because of shifting politics, funding, and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is about to change. Through NASA's &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/"&gt;Artemis II mission&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled to launch no earlier than September 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/our-artemis-crew/"&gt;four astronauts&lt;/a&gt; will be the first humans to travel to the moon in more than 50 years. In 2022, the uncrewed &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-i/"&gt;Artemis I mission&lt;/a&gt; proved the ability of NASA's new spacecraft &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/reference/orion-spacecraft/"&gt;Orion&lt;/a&gt; — launched on the new heavy-lift rocket, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/"&gt;Space Launch System&lt;/a&gt; — to travel farther into space than ever before and return safely to Earth. Building on that success, the 10-day Artemis II mission will pave the way for &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/"&gt;Artemis III&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface, with the goal of establishing a future lasting human presence on the moon and preparing for human missions to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One big step for lasercom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artemis II will be historic not only for renewing human exploration beyond Earth, but also for being the first crewed lunar flight to demonstrate laser communication (lasercom) technologies, which are poised to revolutionize how spacecraft communicate. Researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory have been developing such technologies for more than two decades, and NASA has been infusing them into its missions to meet the growing demands of long-distance and data-intensive space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As spacecraft push farther into deep space and advanced science instruments collect ultrahigh-definition (HD) data like 4K video and images, missions need better ways to transmit data back to Earth. Communication systems that encode data onto infrared laser light instead of radio waves can send more information at once and be packaged more compactly while operating with less power. Greater volumes of data fuel additional discoveries, and size and power efficiency translate to increased space for science instruments or crew, less expensive launches, and longer-lasting spacecraft batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Artemis II, the Orion Artemis II Optical Communications System (O2O) will send high-resolution video and images of the lunar surface down to Earth — a stark contrast to the blurry, grainy footage from the Apollo program. In addition, O2O will send and receive procedures, data files, flight plans, voice calls, and other communications, serving as a high-speed data pipeline between the astronauts on Orion and mission control on Earth. O2O will beam information via lasers at up to 260 megabits per second (Mbps) to ground optical stations in one of two NASA locations: the White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico, or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Table Mountain Facility in Wrightwood, California. Both locations are ideal for their minimal cloud coverage, which can obstruct laser signals as they enter Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of O2O is the Lincoln Laboratory–developed Modular, Agile, Scalable Optical Terminal (MAScOT). About the size of a house cat, MAScOT features a 4-inch telescope mounted on a two-axis pivoted support (gimbal), and fixed back-end optics. The gimbal precisely points the telescope and tracks the laser beam through which communications signals are emitted and received, in the direction of the desired data recipient or sender. Underneath the gimbal, in a separate assembly, are the back-end optics, which contain light-focusing lenses, tracking sensors, fast-steering mirrors, and other components to finely point the laser beam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A series of firsts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAScOT made its debut in space as part of the laboratory's Integrated Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) LEO User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), which &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/illuma-t-launches-international-space-station"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; to the International Space Station (ISS) in November 2023. After a few weeks of preliminary testing, ILLUMA-T transmitted its &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/technology/space-comms/nasas-space-station-laser-comm-terminal-achieves-first-link/"&gt;first beam of laser light&lt;/a&gt; to NASA's LCRD satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit 22,000 miles above Earth's surface. Achieving this critical step, known as "first light," required precise pointing, acquisition, and tracking of laser beams between moving spacecraft.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the following six months, the laboratory team performed experiments to test and characterize the system's basic functionality, performance, and utility for human crews and user applications. Initially, the team checked whether the ILLUMA-T-to-LCRD optical link was operating at the intended data rates in both directions: 622 Mbps down and 51 Mbps up. In fact, even higher data rates were achieved: 1.2 gigabits per second down and 155 Mbps up. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This first demonstration of a two-way, end-to-end laser communications relay system, in which ILLUMA-T was the first LEO user of LCRD, is a major milestone for NASA and other space organizations," says Bryan Robinson, leader of the laboratory's &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/communication-systems/optical-and-quantum-communications"&gt;Optical and Quantum Communications Group&lt;/a&gt;. "It serves as a precursor to optical relays at the moon and Mars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the relay was up and running, the team assessed how parameters such as laser transmit power, optical wavelength, and relative sun angles impact terminal performance. Lastly, they contributed to several networking experiments over multiple nodes to and from the ISS, using NASA's &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/technology/space-comms/delay-disruption-tolerant-networking-overview/"&gt;delay/disruption tolerant networking protocols&lt;/a&gt;. One landmark experiment &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/nasa-streams-first-4k-video-from-aircraft-to-space-station-back/"&gt;streamed 4K video&lt;/a&gt; on a round-trip journey from an airplane flying over Lake Erie in Ohio, to the NASA Glenn Research Center in nearby Cleveland, to the NASA White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, to LCRD in GEO, to ILLUMA-T on the ISS, and then back. In June 2024, ILLUMA-T communicated with LCRD for the last time and powered off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our success with ILLUMA-T lays the foundation for streaming HD video to and from the moon," says co-principal investigator Jade Wang, an assistant leader of the Optical and Quantum Communications Group. "You can imagine the Artemis astronauts using videoconferencing to connect with physicians, coordinate mission activities, and livestream their lunar trips."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moon ready&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artemis II O2O mission will employ the same overall MAScOT design proven on ILLUMA-T. Lincoln Laboratory delivered the payload to NASA's Kennedy Space Center for installation and testing on the Orion spacecraft in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technology transfer to government is what Lincoln Laboratory does as a federally funded research and development center," explains lead systems engineer Farzana Khatri, a senior staff member in the Optical and Quantum Communications Group. "We not only transfer technology, but also work with our transfer partner to ensure success. To prepare for O2O, we are leveraging lessons learned during ILLUMA-T operations. Recently, we conducted pre-mission dry runs to enhance coordination among the various teams involved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the laboratory completed an important milestone for the O2O optical terminal: the mission readiness test. The test involved three phases. In the first phase, they validated terminal command and telemetry functions. While laboratory-developed ground software was directly used to command and control ILLUMA-T, for O2O, it will run in the background and all commands and telemetry will be interfaced through software developed by NASA's Johnson Space Center &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/johnson/jsc-mission-control-center/"&gt;Mission Control Center&lt;/a&gt;. In the second phase, the team tested different user applications, including activating some of Orion's HD cameras and sending videos from Cape Canaveral to Johnson Space Center as a mock-up for the actual space link. They also ran file transfers, video conferencing, and other operations on astronaut personal computing devices. In the third phase, they simulated payload commissioning activities, such as popping the latch on the optical hardware and moving the gimbal, and conducting ground terminal operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For O2O, we want to show that this optical link works and is helpful to astronauts and the mission," Khatri says. "The Orion spacecraft collects a huge amount of data within the first day of a mission, and typically these data sit on the spacecraft until it lands and take months to be offloaded. With an optical link running at the highest rate, we should be able to get data down to Earth within a few hours for immediate analysis. Furthermore, astronauts can stay in touch with Earth during their journey, inspiring the public and the next generation of deep-space explorers, much like the Apollo 11 astronauts who first landed on the moon 55 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O2O is funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/space-operations/space-communications-and-navigation-scan-program/"&gt;Space Communication and Navigation program&lt;/a&gt; at NASA Headquarters in Washington. O2O was developed by a team of engineers from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Lincoln Laboratory. This collaboration has led to multiple lasercom missions, such as the 2013 &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/tech-demonstration/laser-communications-relay/historic-demonstration-proves-laser-communication-possible/"&gt;Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 LCRD, the 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/communications-system-achieves-fastest-laser-link-space-yet"&gt;TeraByte Infrared Delivery&lt;/a&gt;, and the 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/illuma-t-launches-international-space-station"&gt;ILLUMA-T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research (MKI) is a project lead for one of two finalist missions recently &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-establishes-new-class-of-astrophysics-missions-selects-studies/"&gt;selected for NASA's new Probe Explorers program&lt;/a&gt;. Working with collaborators at the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Research Center, the team will produce a one-year concept study to launch the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) in 2032.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erin Kara, associate professor of physics and astrophysicist at MIT, is the deputy principal investigator for AXIS. The MIT team includes MKI scientists Eric Miller, Mark Bautz, Catherine Grant, Michael McDonald, and Kevin Burdge. Says Kara, "I am honored to be working with this amazing team in ushering in a new era for X-ray astronomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AXIS mission is designed to revolutionize the view scientists have of high-energy events and environments in the universe using new technologies capable of seeing even deeper into space and further back in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If selected to move forward," explains Kara, "AXIS will answer some of the biggest mysteries in modern astrophysics, from the formation of supermassive black holes to the progenitors of the most energetic and explosive events in the universe to the effects of stars on exoplanets. Simply put, it's the next-generation observatory we need to transform our understanding of the universe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical to AXIS's success is the CCD focal plane —&amp;nbsp;an array of imaging devices that record the properties of the light coming into the telescope. If selected, MKI scientists will work with colleagues at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Stanford University to develop this high-speed camera, which sits at the heart of the telescope, connected to the X-ray Mirror Assembly and telescope tube. The work to create the array builds on previous imaging technology developed by MKI and Lincoln Laboratory, including instruments flying on the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Suzaku X-ray Observatory, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camera lead Eric Miller notes that "the advanced detectors that we will use provide the same excellent sensitivity as previous instruments, but operating up to 100 times faster to keep up with all of the X-rays focused by the mirror." As such, the development of the CCD focal plane will have significant impact in both scientific and technological realms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Engineering the array over the next year," adds Kara, "will lay the groundwork not just for AXIS, but for future missions as well."&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers at MIT has discovered that a distant interstellar cloud contains an abundance of pyrene, a type of large, carbon-containing molecule known as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of pyrene in this far-off cloud, which is similar to the collection of dust and gas&amp;nbsp;that eventually became our own solar system, suggests that pyrene may have been the source of much of the carbon in our solar system. That hypothesis is also supported by a recent finding that samples returned from the near-Earth asteroid Ryugu contain large quantities of pyrene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big questions in star and planet formation is: How much of the chemical inventory from that early molecular cloud is inherited and forms the base components of the solar system? What we’re looking at is the start and the end, and they’re showing the same thing. That’s pretty strong evidence that this material from the early molecular cloud finds its way into the ice, dust, and rocky bodies that make up our solar system,” says Brett McGuire, an assistant professor of chemistry at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its symmetry, pyrene itself is invisible to the radio astronomy techniques that have been used to detect about 95 percent of molecules in space. Instead, the researchers detected an isomer of cyanopyrene, a version of pyrene that has reacted with cyanide to break its symmetry. The molecule was detected in a distant cloud known as TMC-1, using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT), a radio telescope at the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGuire and Ilsa Cooke, an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of British Colombia,&amp;nbsp;are the senior authors of a paper describing the findings, which &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq6391" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gabi Wenzel, an MIT postdoc in McGuire’s group, is the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon in space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAHs, which contain rings of carbon atoms fused together, are believed to store 10 to 25 percent of the carbon that exists in space. More than 40 years ago, scientists using infrared telescopes began detecting features that are thought to belong to vibrational modes of PAHs in space, but this technique couldn’t reveal exactly which types of PAHs were out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the PAH hypothesis was developed in the 1980s, many people have accepted that PAHs are in space, and they have been found in meteorites, comets, and asteroid samples, but we can’t really use infrared spectroscopy to unambiguously identify individual PAHs in space,” Wenzel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, a team led by McGuire reported the discovery of benzonitrile — a six-carbon ring attached to a nitrile (carbon-nitrogen) group — in TMC-1. To make this discovery, they used the GBT, which can detect molecules in space by their rotational spectra —&amp;nbsp;distinctive patterns of light that molecules give off as they tumble through space. In 2021, his team detected the first individual PAHs in space: two isomers of cyanonaphthalene, which consists of two rings fused together, with a nitrile group attached to one ring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Earth, PAHs commonly occur as byproducts of burning fossil fuels, and they’re also found in char marks on grilled food. Their discovery in TMC-1, which is only about 10 kelvins, suggested that it may also be possible for them to form at very low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that PAHs have also been found in meteorites, asteroids, and comets has led many scientists to hypothesize that PAHs are the source of much of the carbon that formed our own solar system. In 2023, researchers in Japan found large quantities of pyrene in samples returned from the asteroid Ryugu during the Hayabusa2 mission, along with smaller PAHs including naphthalene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That discovery motivated McGuire and his colleagues to look for pyrene in TMC-1. Pyrene, which contains four rings, is larger than any of the other PAHs that have been detected in space. In fact, it’s the third-largest molecule identified in space, and the largest ever detected using radio astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before looking for these molecules in space, the researchers first had to synthesize cyanopyrene in the laboratory. The cyano or nitrile group is necessary for the molecule to emit a signal that a radio telescope can detect. The synthesis was performed by MIT postdoc Shuo Zhang in the group of Alison Wendlandt, an MIT associate professor of chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the researchers analyzed the signals that the molecules emit in the laboratory, which are exactly the same as the signals that they emit in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the GBT, the researchers found these signatures throughout TMC-1. They also found that cyanopyrene accounts for about 0.1 percent of all the carbon found in the cloud, which sounds small but is significant when one considers the thousands of different types of carbon-containing molecules that exist in space, McGuire says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While 0.1 percent doesn’t sound like a large number, most carbon is trapped in carbon monoxide (CO), the second-most abundant molecule in the universe besides molecular hydrogen. If we set CO aside, one in every few hundred or so remaining carbon atoms is in pyrene. Imagine the thousands of different molecules that are out there, nearly all of them with many different carbon atoms in them, and one in a few hundred is in pyrene,” he says. “That is an absolutely massive abundance. An almost unbelievable sink of carbon. It’s an interstellar island of stability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ewine van Dishoeck, a professor of molecular astrophysics at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands, called the discovery “unexpected and exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds on their earlier discoveries of smaller aromatic molecules, but to make the jump now to the pyrene family is huge. Not only does it demonstrate that a significant fraction of carbon is locked up in these molecules, but it also points to different formation routes of aromatics than have been considered so far,” says van Dishoeck, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An abundance of pyrene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interstellar clouds like TMC-1 may eventually give rise to stars, as clumps of dust and gas coalesce into larger bodies and begin to heat up. Planets, asteroids, and comets arise from some of the gas and dust that surround young stars. Scientists can’t look back in time at the interstellar cloud that gave rise to our own solar system, but the discovery of pyrene in TMC-1, along with the presence of large amounts of pyrene in the asteroid Ryugu, suggests that pyrene may have been the source of much of the carbon in our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have, I would venture to say, the strongest evidence ever of this direct molecular inheritance from the cold cloud all the way through to the actual rocks in the solar system,” McGuire says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to look for even larger PAH molecules in TMC-1. They also hope to investigate the question of whether the pyrene found in TMC-1 was formed within the cold cloud or whether it arrived from elsewhere in the universe, possibly from the high-energy combustion processes that surround dying stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded in part by a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator Award, the Schmidt Futures, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Goddard Center for Astrobiology, and the NASA Planetary Science Division Internal Scientist Funding Program.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many black holes detected to date appear to be part of a pair. These binary systems comprise a black hole and a secondary object — such as a star, a much denser neutron star, or another black hole — that spiral around each other, drawn together by the black hole’s gravity to form a tight orbital pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a surprising discovery is expanding the picture of black holes, the objects they can host, and the way they form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08120-6" target="_blank"&gt;study appearing today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; physicists at MIT and Caltech report that they have observed a “black hole triple” for the first time. The new system holds a central black hole in the act of consuming a small star that’s spiraling in very close to the black hole, every 6.5 days — a configuration similar to most binary systems. But surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the black hole, though at a much greater distance. The physicists estimate this far-off companion is orbiting the black hole every 70,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the black hole seems to have a gravitational hold on an object so far away is raising questions about the origins of the black hole itself. Black holes are thought to form from the violent explosion of a dying star — a process known as a supernova, by which a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in a final burst before collapsing into an invisible black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s discovery, however, suggests that if the newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it collapsed would have kicked away any loosely bound objects in its outskirts. The second, outer star, then, shouldn’t still be hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the team suspects the black hole formed through a more gentle process of “direct collapse,” in which a star simply caves in on itself, forming a black hole without a last dramatic flash. Such a gentle origin would hardly disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the new triple system includes a very far-off star, this suggests the system’s black hole was born through a gentler, direct collapse. And while astronomers have observed more violent supernovae for centuries, the team says the new triple system could be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,” says study author Kevin Burdge, a Pappalardo Fellow in the MIT Department of Physics. “This system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors at MIT are Erin Kara, Claude Canizares, Deepto Chakrabarty, Anna Frebel, Sarah Millholland, Saul Rappaport, Rob Simcoe, and Andrew Vanderburg, along with Kareem El-Badry at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tandem motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the black hole triple came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through Aladin Lite, a repository of astronomical observations, aggregated from telescopes in space and all around the world. Astronomers can use the online tool to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes that are tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had been looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni — a black hole about 8,000 light years from Earth that was one of the very first objects ever to be confirmed as a black hole, in 1992. Since then, V404 Cygni has become one of the most well-studied black holes, and has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers. However, none of those studies reported what Burdge and his colleagues observed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he looked at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what appeared to be two blobs of light, surprisingly close to each other. The first blob was what others determined to be the black hole and an inner, closely orbiting star. The star is so close that it is shedding some of its material onto the black hole, and giving off the light that Burdge could see. The second blob of light, however, was something that scientists did not investigate closely, until now. That second light, Burdge determined, was most likely coming from a very far-off star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,” says Burdge, who calculated that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole (1 AU is the distance between the Earth and sun). In other words, the outer star is 3,500 times father away from the black hole as the Earth is from the sun. This is also equal to 100 times the distance between Pluto and the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question that then came to mind was whether the outer star was linked to the black hole and its inner star. To answer this, the researchers looked to Gaia, a satellite that has precisely tracked the motions of all the stars in the galaxy since 2014. The team analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the last 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved exactly in tandem, compared to other neighboring stars. They calculated that the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,” Burdge says. “We’re seeing two stars that are following each other because they’re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulling strings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How, then, could the system have formed? If the black hole arose from a typical supernova, the violent explosion would have kicked away the outer star long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine you’re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you’re pulling with a spider web,” Burdge says. “If you tugged too hard, the web would break and you’d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that’s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you’re going to lose the outer star.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To really test this idea, however, Burdge carried out simulations to see how such a triple system could have evolved and retained the outer star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of each simulation, he introduced three stars (the third being the black hole, before it became a black hole). He then ran tens of thousands of simulations, each one with a slightly different scenario for how the third star could have become a black hole, and subsequently affected the motions of the other two stars. For instance, he simulated a supernova, varying the amount and direction of energy that it gave off. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, in which the third star simply caved in on itself to form a black hole, without giving off any energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,” Burdge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to giving clues to the black hole’s origins, the outer star has also revealed the system’s age. The physicists observed that the outer star happens to be in the process of becoming a red giant — a phase that occurs at the end of a star’s life. Based on this stellar transition, the team determined that the outer star is about 4 billion years old. Given that neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team concludes that the black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,” Burdge says. “Now we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Astronomers detect ancient lonely quasars with murky origins</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A quasar is the extremely bright core of a galaxy that hosts an active supermassive black hole at its center. As the black hole draws in surrounding gas and dust, it blasts out an enormous amount of energy, making quasars some of the brightest objects in the universe. Quasars have been observed as early as a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, and it’s been a mystery as to how these objects could have grown so bright and massive in such a short amount of cosmic time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have proposed that the earliest quasars sprang from overly dense regions of primordial matter, which would also have produced many smaller galaxies in the quasars’ environment.&amp;nbsp;But in a new MIT-led study, astronomers observed some ancient quasars that appear to be surprisingly alone in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronomers used NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to peer back in time, more than 13 billion years, to study the cosmic surroundings of five known ancient quasars. They found a surprising variety in their neighborhoods, or “quasar fields.” While some quasars reside in very crowded fields with more than 50 neighboring galaxies, as all models predict, the remaining quasars appear to drift in voids, with only a few stray galaxies in their vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lonely quasars are challenging physicists’ understanding of how such luminous objects could have formed so early on in the universe, without a significant source of surrounding matter to fuel their black hole growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Contrary to previous belief, we find on average, these quasars are not necessarily in those highest-density regions of the early universe. Some of them seem to be sitting in the middle of nowhere,” says Anna-Christina Eilers, assistant professor of physics at MIT. “It’s difficult to explain how these quasars could have grown so big if they appear to have nothing to feed from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a possibility that these quasars may not be as solitary as they appear, but are instead surrounded by galaxies that are heavily shrouded in dust and therefore hidden from view. Eilers and her colleagues hope to tune their observations to try and see through any such cosmic dust, in order to understand how quasars grew so big, so fast, in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eilers and her colleagues report their findings in a &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad778b" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today in the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The MIT co-authors include postdocs Rohan Naidu and Minghao Yue; Robert Simcoe, the Francis Friedman Professor of Physics and director of MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research; and collaborators from institutions including Leiden University, the University of California at Santa Barbara, ETH Zurich, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galactic neighbors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five newly observed quasars are among the oldest quasars observed to date. More than 13 billion years old, the objects are thought to have formed between 600 to 700 million years after the Big Bang. The supermassive black holes powering the quasars are a billion times more massive than the sun, and more than a trillion times brighter. Due to their extreme luminosity, the light from each quasar is able to travel over the age of the universe, far enough to reach JWST’s highly sensitive detectors today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just phenomenal that we now have a telescope that can capture light from 13 billion years ago in so much detail,” Eilers says. “For the first time, JWST enabled us to look at the environment of these quasars, where they grew up, and what their neighborhood was like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed images of the five ancient quasars taken by JWST between August 2022 and June 2023. The observations of each quasar comprised multiple “mosaic” images, or partial views of the quasar’s field, which the team effectively stitched together to produce a complete picture of each quasar’s surrounding neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telescope also took measurements of light in multiple wavelengths across each quasar’s field, which the team then processed to determine whether a given object in the field was light from a neighboring galaxy, and how far a galaxy is from the much more luminous central quasar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the only difference between these five quasars is that their environments look so different,” Eilers says. “For instance, one quasar has almost 50 galaxies around it, while another has just two. And both quasars are within the same size, volume, brightness, and time of the universe. That was really surprising to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth spurts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disparity in quasar fields introduces a kink in the standard picture of black hole growth and galaxy formation. According to physicists’ best understanding of how the first objects in the universe emerged, a cosmic web of dark matter should have set the course. Dark matter is an as-yet unknown form of matter that has no other interactions with its surroundings other than through gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the Big Bang, the early universe is thought to have formed filaments of dark matter that acted as a sort of gravitational road, attracting gas and dust along its tendrils. In overly dense regions of this web, matter would have accumulated to form more massive objects. And the brightest, most massive early objects, such as quasars, would have formed in the web’s highest-density regions, which would have also churned out many more, smaller galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cosmic web of dark matter is a solid prediction of our cosmological model of the Universe, and it can be described in detail using numerical simulations,” says co-author Elia Pizzati, a graduate student at Leiden University. “By comparing our observations to these simulations, we can determine where in the cosmic web quasars are located.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists estimate that quasars would have had to grow continuously with very high accretion rates in order to reach the extreme mass and luminosities at the times that astronomers have observed them, fewer than 1 billion years after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main question we’re trying to answer is, how do these billion-solar-mass black holes form at a time when the universe is still really, really young? It’s still in its infancy,” Eilers says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings may raise more questions than answers. The “lonely” quasars appear to live in relatively empty regions of space. If physicists’ cosmological models are correct, these barren regions signify very little dark matter, or starting material for brewing up stars and galaxies. How, then, did extremely bright and massive quasars come to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results show that there’s still a significant piece of the puzzle missing of how these supermassive black holes grow,” Eilers says. “If there’s not enough material around for some quasars to be able to grow continuously, that means there must be some other way that they can grow, that we have yet to figure out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the European Research Council.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With its latest space mission successfully launched, NASA is set to return for a close-up investigation of Jupiter’s moon Europa. Yesterday at 12:06 p.m. EDT, the Europa Clipper lifted off via SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on a mission that will take a close look at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Europa’s icy surface. Five years from now, the spacecraft will visit the moon, which hosts a water ocean covered by a water-ice shell. The spacecraft’s mission is to learn more about the composition and geology of the moon’s surface and interior and to assess its astrobiological potential. Because of Jupiter’s intense radiation environment, Europa Clipper will conduct a series of flybys, with its closest approach bringing it within just 16 miles of Europa’s surface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) Research Scientist Jason Soderblom is a co-investigator on two of the spacecraft’s instruments: the Europa Imaging System and the Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa. Over the past nine years, he and his fellow team members have been building imaging and mapping instruments to study Europa’s surface in detail to gain a better understanding of previously seen geologic features, as well as the chemical composition of the materials that are present. Here, he describes the mission's primary plans and goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do we currently know about Europa’s surface?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We know from &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/galileo/" target="_blank"&gt;NASA Galileo mission&lt;/a&gt; data that the surface crust is relatively thin, but we don’t know how thin it is. One of the goals of the Europa Clipper mission is to measure the thickness of that ice shell. The surface is riddled with fractures that indicate tectonism is actively resurfacing the moon. Its crust is primarily composed of water ice, but there are also exposures of non-ice material along these fractures and ridges that we believe include material coming up from within Europa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that makes investigating the materials on the surface more difficult is the environment. Jupiter is a significant source of radiation, and Europa is relatively close to Jupiter. That radiation modifies the materials on the surface; understanding that radiation damage is a key component to understanding the composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also what drives the clipper-style mission and gives the mission its name: we clip by Europa, collect data, and then spend the majority of our time outside of the radiation environment. That allows us time to download the data, analyze it, and make plans for the next flyby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Did that pose a significant challenge when it came to instrument design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, and this is one of the reasons that we're just now returning to do this mission. The concept of this mission came about around the time of the Galileo mission in the late 1990s, so it's been roughly 25 years since scientists first wanted to carry out this mission. A lot of that time has been figuring out how to deal with the radiation environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of tricks that we've been developing over the years. The instruments are heavily shielded, and lots of modeling has gone into figuring exactly where to put that shielding. We've also developed very specific techniques to collect data. For example, by taking a whole bunch of short observations, we can look for the signature of this radiation noise, remove it from the little bits of data here and there, add the good data together, and end up with a low-radiation-noise observation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You're involved with the two different imaging and mapping instruments: the &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/eis/"&gt;Europa Imaging System&lt;/a&gt; (EIS) and the &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments/mise/"&gt;Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa&lt;/a&gt; (MISE). How are they different from each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The camera system [EIS] is primarily focused on understanding the physics and the geology that's driving processes on the surface, looking for: fractured zones; regions that we refer to as chaos terrain, where it looks like icebergs have been suspended in a slurry of water and have jumbled around and mixed and twisted; regions where we believe the surface is colliding and subduction is occurring, so one section of the surface is going beneath the other; and other regions that are spreading, so new surface is being created like our mid-ocean ridges on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectrometer’s [MISE] primary function is to constrain the composition of the surface. In particular, we're really interested in sections where we think liquid water might have come to the surface. Understanding what material is from within Europa and what material is being deposited from external sources is also important, and separating that is necessary to understand the composition of those coming from Europa and using that to learn about the composition of the subsurface ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an intersection between those two, and that's my interest in the mission. We have color imaging with our imaging system that can provide some crude understanding of the composition, and there is a mapping component to our spectrometer that allows us to understand how the materials that we're detecting are physically distributed and correlate with the geology. So there's a way to examine the intersection of those two disciplines —&amp;nbsp;to extrapolate the compositional information derived from the spectrometer to much higher resolutions using the camera, and to extrapolate the geological information that we learn from the camera to the compositional constraints from the spectrometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do those mission goals align with the research that you've been doing here at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the other major missions that I've been involved with was the Cassini mission, primarily working with the &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/cassini/spacecraft/cassini-orbiter/visible-and-infrared-mapping-spectrometer/"&gt;Visual and Infrared Spectrometer team&lt;/a&gt; to understand the geology and composition of Saturn's moon Titan. That instrument is very similar to the MISE instrument, both in function and in science objective, and so there's a very strong connection between that and the Europa Clipper mission. For another mission, for which I’m leading the camera team, is working to retrieve a sample of a comet, and my primary function on that mission is understanding the geology of the cometary surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you most excited about learning from the Europa Clipper mission?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm most fascinated with some of these very unique geologic features that we see on the surface of Europa, understanding the composition of the material that is involved, and the processes that are driving those features. In particular, the chaos terrains and the fractures that we see on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; It's going to be a while before the spacecraft finally reaches Europa. What work needs to be done in the meantime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; A key component of this mission will be the laboratory work here on Earth, expanding our spectral libraries so that when we collect a spectrum of Europa's surface, we can compare that to laboratory measurements. We are also in the process of developing a number of models to allow us to, for example, understand how a material might process and change starting in the ocean and working its way up through fractures and eventually to the surface. Developing these models now is an important piece before we collect these data, then we can make corrections and get improved observations as the mission progresses. Making the best and most efficient use of the spacecraft resources requires an ability to reprogram and refine observations in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They planned to fly for four years and to get as far as Jupiter and Saturn. But nearly half a century and 15 billion miles later, NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft have far exceeded their original mission, winging past the outer planets and busting out of our heliosphere, beyond the influence of the sun. The probes are currently making their way through interstellar space, traveling farther than any human-made object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Along their improbable journey, the Voyagers made first-of-their-kind observations at all four giant outer planets and their moons using only a handful of instruments, including MIT’s Plasma Science Experiments — identical plasma sensors that were designed and built in the 1970s in Building 37 by MIT scientists and engineers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Plasma Science Experiment (also known as the Plasma Spectrometer, or PLS for short) measured charged particles in planetary magnetospheres, the solar wind, and the interstellar medium, the material between stars. Since launching on the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1977, the PLS has revealed new phenomena near all the outer planets and in the solar wind across the solar system. The experiment played a crucial role in confirming the moment when Voyager 2 crossed the heliosphere and moved outside of the sun’s regime, into interstellar space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, to conserve the little power left on Voyager 2 and prolong the mission’s life, the Voyager scientists and engineers have made the decision to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-turns-off-science-instrument-to-save-voyager-2-power/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;shut off MIT’s Plasma Science Experiment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It’s the first in a line of science instruments that will progressively blink off over the coming years. On Sept. 26, the Voyager 2 PLS sent its last communication from 12.7 billion miles away, before it received the command to shut down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with John Belcher, the Class of 1922 Professor of Physics at MIT, who was a member of the original team that designed and built the plasma spectrometers, and John Richardson, principal research scientist at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who is the experiment’s principal investigator. Both Belcher and Richardson offered their reflections on the retirement of this interstellar piece of MIT history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Looking back at the experiment’s contributions, what are the greatest hits, in terms of what MIT’s Plasma Spectrometer has revealed about the solar system and interstellar space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; A key PLS finding at Jupiter was the discovery of the Io torus, a plasma donut surrounding Jupiter, formed from sulphur and oxygen from Io’s volcanos (which were discovered in Voyager images). At Saturn, PLS found a magnetosphere full of water and oxygen that had been knocked off of Saturn’s icy moons. At Uranus and Neptune, the tilt of the magnetic fields led to PLS seeing smaller density features, with Uranus’ plasma disappearing near the planet. Another key PLS observation was of the termination shock, which was the first observation of the plasma at the largest shock in the solar system, where the solar wind stopped being supersonic. This boundary had a huge drop in speed and an increase in the density and temperature of the solar wind. And finally, PLS documented Voyager 2’s crossing of the heliopause by detecting a stopping of outward-flowing plasma. This signaled the end of the solar wind and the beginning of the local interstellar medium (LISM). Although not designed to measure the LISM, PLS constantly measured the interstellar plasma currents beyond the heliosphere. It is very sad to lose this instrument and data!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belcher:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to emphasize that PLS was the result of decades of development by MIT Professor Herbert Bridge (1919-1995) and Alan Lazarus (1931-2014). The first version of the instrument they designed was flown on Explorer 10 in 1961. And the most recent version is flying on the Solar Probe, which is collecting measurements very close to the sun to understand the origins of solar wind. Bridge was the principal investigator for plasma probes on spacecraft which visited the sun and every major planetary body in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;During their tenure aboard the Voyager probes, how did the plasma sensors do their job over the last 47 years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; There were four Faraday cup detectors designed by Herb Bridge that measured currents from ions and electrons that entered the detectors. By measuring these particles at different energies, we could find the plasma velocity, density, and temperature in the solar wind and in the four planetary magnetospheres Voyager encountered. Voyager data were (and are still) sent to Earth every day and received by NASA’s deep space network of antennae. Keeping two 1970s-era spacecraft going for 47 years and counting has been an amazing feat of JPL engineering prowess — you can google the most recent rescue when Voyager 1 lost some memory in November of 2023 and stopped sending data. JPL figured out the problem and was able to reprogram the flight data system from 15 billion miles away, and all is back to normal now. Shutting down PLS involves sending a command which will get to Voyager 2 about 19 hours later, providing the rest of the spacecraft enough power to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the plasma sensors have shut down, how much more could Voyager do, and how far might it still go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richardson:&lt;/strong&gt; Voyager will still measure the galactic cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and plasma waves. The available power decreases about 4 watts per year as the plutonium which powers them decays. We hope to keep some of the instruments running until the mid-2030s, but that will be a challenge as power levels decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belcher:&lt;/strong&gt; Nick Oberg at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in the Netherlands has made an exhaustive study of the future of the spacecraft, using data from the European Space Agency’s spacecraft&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.space.com/41312-gaia-mission.html" target="_blank"&gt;Gaia&lt;/a&gt;. In about 30,000 years, the spacecraft will reach the distance to the nearest stars. Because space is so vast, there is zero chance that the spacecraft will collide directly with a star in the lifetime of the universe. However, the spacecraft surface will erode by microcollisions with vast clouds of interstellar dust, but this happens very slowly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oberg’s estimate, the Golden Records [identical records that were placed aboard each probe, that contain selected sounds and images to represent life on Earth] are likely to survive for a span of over 5 billion years. After those 5 billion years, things are difficult to predict, since at this point, the Milky Way will collide with its massive neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. During this collision, there is a one in five chance that the spacecraft will be flung into the intergalactic medium, where there is little dust and little weathering. In that case, it is possible that the spacecraft will survive for trillions of years. A trillion years is about 100 times the current age of the universe. The Earth ceases to exist in about 6 billion years, when the sun enters its red giant phase and engulfs it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a “poor man’s” version of the Golden Record, Robert Butler, the chief engineer of the Plasma Instrument, inscribed the names of the MIT engineers and scientists who had worked on the spacecraft on the collector plate of the side-looking cup. Butler’s home state was New Hampshire, and he put the state motto, “Live Free or Die,” at the top of the list of names. Thanks to Butler, although New Hampshire will not survive for a trillion years, its state motto might. The flight spare of the PLS instrument is now displayed at the MIT Museum, where you can see the text of Butler’s message by peering into the side-looking sensor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mars wasn’t always the cold desert we see today. There’s increasing evidence that water once flowed on the Red Planet’s surface, billions of years ago. And if there was water, there must also have been a thick atmosphere to keep that water from freezing. But sometime around 3.5 billion years ago, the water dried up, and the air, once heavy with carbon dioxide, dramatically thinned, leaving only the wisp of an atmosphere that clings to the planet today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where exactly did Mars’ atmosphere go? This question has been a central mystery of Mars’ 4.6-billion-year history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two MIT geologists, the answer may lie in the planet’s clay. In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm8443" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, they propose that much of Mars’ missing atmosphere could be locked up in the planet’s clay-covered crust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team makes the case that, while water was present on Mars, the liquid could have trickled through certain rock types and set off a slow chain of reactions that progressively drew carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and converted it into methane — a form of carbon that could be stored for eons in the planet’s clay surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar processes occur in some regions on Earth. The researchers used their knowledge of interactions between rocks and gases on Earth and applied that to how similar processes could play out on Mars. They found that, given how much clay is estimated to cover Mars’ surface, the planet’s clay could hold up to 1.7 bar of carbon dioxide, which would be equivalent to around 80 percent of the planet’s initial, early atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that this sequestered Martian carbon could one day be recovered and converted into propellant to fuel future missions between Mars and Earth, the researchers propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings on Earth, we show that similar processes likely operated on Mars, and that copious amounts of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could have transformed to methane and been sequestered in clays,” says study author Oliver Jagoutz, professor of geology in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “This methane could still be present and maybe even used as an energy source on Mars in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author is recent EAPS graduate Joshua Murray PhD ’24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the folds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagoutz’ group at MIT seeks to identify the geologic processes and interactions that drive the evolution of Earth’s lithosphere — the hard and brittle outer layer that includes the crust and upper mantle, where tectonic plates lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, he and Murray focused on a type of surface clay mineral called smectite, which is known to be a highly effective trap for carbon. Within a single grain of smectite are a multitude of folds, within which carbon can sit undisturbed for billions of years. They showed that smectite on Earth was likely a product of tectonic activity, and that, once exposed at the surface, the clay minerals acted to draw down and store enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to cool the planet over millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the team&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mineral-produced-plate-tectonics-global-cooling-effect-1130" target="_blank"&gt;reported their results&lt;/a&gt;, Jagoutz happened to look at a map of the surface of Mars and realized that much of that planet’s surface was covered in the same smectite clays. Could the clays have had a similar carbon-trapping effect on Mars, and if so, how much carbon could the clays hold?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know this process happens, and it is well-documented on Earth. And these rocks and clays exist on Mars,” Jagoutz says. “So, we wanted to try and connect the dots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Every nook and cranny”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike on Earth, where smectite is a consequence of continental plates shifting and uplifting to bring rocks from the mantle to the surface, there is no such tectonic activity on Mars. The team looked for ways in which the clays could have formed on Mars, based on what scientists know of the planet’s history and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, some remote measurements of Mars’ surface suggest that at least part of the planet’s crust contains ultramafic igneous rocks, similar to those that produce smectites through weathering on Earth. Other observations reveal geologic patterns similar to terrestrial rivers and tributaries, where water could have flowed and reacted with the underlying rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagoutz and Murray wondered whether water could have reacted with Mars’ deep ultramafic rocks in a way that would produce the clays that cover the surface today. They developed a simple model of rock chemistry, based on what is known of how igneous rocks interact with their environment on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied this model to Mars, where scientists believe the crust is mostly made up of igneous rock that is rich in the mineral olivine. The team used the model to estimate the changes that olivine-rich rock might undergo, assuming that water existed on the surface for at least a billion years, and the atmosphere was thick with carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time in Mars’ history, we think&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is everywhere, in every nook and cranny, and water percolating through the rocks is full of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; too,” Murray says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over about a billion years, water trickling through the crust would have slowly reacted with olivine — a mineral that is rich in a reduced form of iron. Oxygen molecules in water would have bound to the iron, releasing hydrogen as a result and forming the red oxidized iron which gives the planet its iconic color. This free hydrogen would then have combined with carbon dioxide in the water, to form methane. As this reaction progressed over time, olivine would have slowly transformed into another type of iron-rich rock known as serpentine, which then continued to react with water to form smectite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These smectite clays have so much capacity to store carbon,” Murray says. “So then we used existing knowledge of how these minerals are stored in clays on Earth, and extrapolate to say, if the Martian surface has this much clay in it, how much methane can you store in those clays?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Jagoutz found that if Mars is covered in a layer of smectite that is 1,100 meters deep, this amount of clay could store a huge amount of methane, equivalent to most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is thought to have disappeared since the planet dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that estimates of global clay volumes on Mars are consistent with a significant fraction of Mars’ initial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being sequestered as organic compounds within the clay-rich crust,” Murray says. “In some ways, Mars’ missing atmosphere could be hiding in plain sight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where the&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; went from an early, thicker atmosphere is a fundamental question in the history of the Mars atmosphere, its climate, and the habitability by microbes,”&amp;nbsp;says Bruce Jakosky, professor emeritus of geology at the University of Colorado and&amp;nbsp;principal investigator on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, which has been orbiting and studying Mars’ upper atmosphere since 2014. Jakosky was not involved with the current study.&amp;nbsp;“Murray and Jagoutz examine the chemical interaction of rocks with the atmosphere as a means of removing CO2.&amp;nbsp;At the high end of our estimates of how much weathering has occurred, this could be a major process in removing&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;from Mars’ early atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[EAPS PhD student Jared Bryan found a way to use his research on earthquakes to help understand exoplanet migration.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Jared Bryan talks about his seismology research, it’s with a natural finesse. He’s a fifth-year PhD student working with MIT Assistant Professor William Frank on seismology research, drawn in by the lab’s combination of GPS observations, satellites, and seismic station data to understand the underlying physics of earthquakes. He has no trouble talking about seismic velocity in fault zones or how he first became interested in the field after summer internships with the Southern California Earthquake Center as an undergraduate student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely like a more down-to-earth kind of seismology,” he jokingly describes it. It’s an odd comment. Where else could earthquakes be but on Earth? But it’s because Bryan finished a research project that has culminated in a new paper — &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02351-3" target="_blank"&gt;published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — involving seismic activity not on Earth, but on stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PhD students in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) are required to complete two research projects as part of their general exam. The first is often in their main focus of research and the foundations of what will become their thesis work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the second project has a special requirement: It must be in a different specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having that built into the structure of the PhD is really, really nice,” says Bryan, who hadn’t known about the special requirement when he decided to come to EAPS. “I think it helps you build curiosity and find what's interesting about what other people are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having so many different, yet still related, fields of study housed in one department makes it easier for students with a strong sense of curiosity to explore the interconnected interactions of Earth science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think everyone here is excited about a lot of different stuff, but we can’t do everything,” says Frank, the Victor P. Starr Career Development Professor of Geophysics. “This is a great way to get students to try something else that they maybe would have wanted to do in a parallel dimension, interact with other advisors, and see that science can be done in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Bryan was worried that the nature of the second project would be a restrictive diversion from his main PhD research. But Associate Professor Julien de Wit was looking for someone with a seismology background to look at some stellar observations he’d collected back in 2016. &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/star-stellar-pulsations-planet-0214"&gt;A star’s brightness was pulsating at a very specific frequency&lt;/a&gt; that had to be caused by changes in the star itself, so Bryan decided to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised by how the kind of seismology that he was looking for was similar to the seismology that we were first doing in the ’60s and ’70s, like large-scale global Earth seismology,” says Bryan. “I thought it would be a way to rethink the foundations of the field that I had been studying applied to a new region.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going from earthquakes to starquakes is not a one-to-one comparison. While the foundational knowledge was there, movement of stars comes from a variety of sources like magnetism or the Coriolis effect, and in a variety of forms. In addition to the sound and pressure waves of earthquakes, they also have gravity waves, all of which happen on a scale much more massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to stretch your mind a bit, because you can’t actually visit these places,” Bryan says. “It’s an unbelievable luxury that we have in Earth seismology that the things that we study are on Google Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are benefits to bringing in scientists from outside an area of expertise. De Wit, who served as Bryan’s supervisor for the project and is also an author on the paper, points out that they bring a fresh perspective and approach by asking unique questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things that people in the field would just take for granted are challenged by their questions,” he says, adding that Bryan was transparent about what he did and didn’t know, allowing for a rich exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal resonance locking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan eventually found that the changes in the star’s brightness were caused by tidal resonance. Resonance is a physical occurrence where waves interact and amplify each other. The most common analogy is pushing someone on a swing set; when the person pushing does it at just the right time, it helps the person on the swing go higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tidal resonance is where you’re pushing at exactly the same frequency as they’re swinging, and the locking happens when both of those frequencies are changing,” Bryan explains. The person pushing the swing gets tired and pushes less often, while the chain of the swing change length. (Bryan jokes that here the analogy starts to break down.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a star changes over the course of its lifetime, tidal resonance locking can cause hot Jupiters, which are massive exoplanets that orbit very close to their host stars, to change orbital distances. This wandering migration, as they call it, explains how some hot Jupiters get so close to their host stars. They also found that the path they take to get there is not always smooth. It can speed up, slow down, or even regress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important implication from the paper is that tidal resonance locking could be used as an exoplanet detection tool, confirming de Wit’s hypothesis from the original 2016 observation that the pulsations had the potential to be used in such a way. If changes in the star’s brightness can be linked to this resonance locking, it may indicate planets that can’t be detected using current methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As below, so above&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most EAPS PhD students don’t advance their project beyond the requirements for the general exam, let alone get a paper out of it. At first, Bryan worried that continuing with it would end up being a distraction from his main work, but ultimately was glad that he committed to it and was able to contribute something meaningful to the emerging field of asteroseismology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s evidence that Jared is excited about what he does and has the drive and scientific skepticism to have done the extra steps to make sure that what he was doing was a real contribution to the scientific literature,” says Frank. “He’s a great example of success and what we hope for our students.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While de Wit didn’t manage to convince Bryan to switch to exoplanet research permanently, he is “excited that there is the opportunity to keep on working together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he finishes his PhD, Bryan plans on continuing in academia as a professor running a research lab, shifting his focus onto volcano seismology and improving instrumentation for the field. He’s open to the possibility of taking his findings on Earth and applying them to volcanoes on other planetary bodies, such as those found on Venus and Jupiter’s moon Io.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to be the bridge between those two things,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a new study, MIT physicists propose that if most of the dark matter in the universe is made up of microscopic primordial black holes — an idea first proposed in the 1970s — then these gravitational dwarfs should zoom through our solar system at least once per decade. A flyby like this, the researchers predict, would introduce a wobble into Mars’ orbit, to a degree that today’s technology could actually detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a detection could lend support to the idea that primordial black holes are a primary source of dark matter throughout the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given decades of precision telemetry, scientists know the distance between Earth and Mars to an accuracy of about 10 centimeters,” says study author David Kaiser, professor of physics and the&amp;nbsp;Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science&amp;nbsp;at MIT. “We’re taking advantage of this highly instrumented region of space to try and look for a small effect. If we see it, that would count as a real reason to keep pursuing this delightful idea that all of dark matter consists of black holes that were spawned in less than a second after the Big Bang and have been streaming around the universe for 14 billion years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.063533" target="_blank"&gt;report their findings today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Physical Review D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The study’s co-authors are lead author Tung Tran ’24, who is now a graduate student at Stanford University; Sarah Geller ’12, SM ’17, PhD ’23, who is now a postdoc at the University of California at Santa Cruz; and MIT Pappalardo Fellow Benjamin Lehmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond particles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 20 percent of all physical matter is made from visible stuff, from stars and planets, to the kitchen sink. The rest is composed of dark matter, a hypothetical form of matter that is invisible across the entire electromagnetic spectrum yet is thought to pervade the universe and exert a gravitational force large enough to affect the motion of stars and galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists have erected detectors on Earth to try and spot dark matter and pin down its properties. For the most part, these experiments assume that dark matter exists as a form of exotic particle that might scatter and decay into observable particles as it passes through a given experiment. But so far, such particle-based searches have come up empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, another possibility, first introduced in the 1970s, has regained traction: Rather than taking on a particle form, dark matter could exist as microscopic, primordial black holes that formed in the first moments following the Big Bang. Unlike the astrophysical black holes that form from the collapse of old stars, primordial black holes would have formed from the collapse of dense pockets of gas in the very early universe and would have scattered across the cosmos as the universe expanded and cooled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These primordial black holes would have collapsed an enormous amount of mass into a tiny space. The majority of these primordial black holes could be as small as a single atom and as heavy as the largest asteroids. It would be conceivable, then, that such tiny giants could exert a gravitational force that could explain at least a portion of dark matter. For the MIT team, this possibility raised an initially frivolous question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think someone asked me what would happen if a primordial black hole passed through a human body,” recalls Tung, who did a quick pencil-and-paper calculation to find that if such a black hole zinged within 1 meter of a person, the force of the black hole would push the person 6 meters, or about 20 feet away in a single second. Tung also found that the odds were astronomically unlikely that a primordial black hole would pass anywhere near a person on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their interest piqued, the researchers took Tung’s calculations a step further, to estimate how a black hole flyby might affect much larger bodies such as the Earth and the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We extrapolated to see what would happen if a black hole flew by Earth and caused the moon to wobble by a little bit,” Tung says. “The numbers we got were not very clear. There are many other dynamics in the solar system that could act as some sort of friction to cause the wobble to dampen out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close encounters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a clearer picture, the team generated a relatively simple simulation of the solar system that incorporates the orbits and gravitational interactions between all the planets, and some of the largest moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“State-of-the-art simulations of the solar system include more than a million objects, each of which has a tiny residual effect,” Lehmann notes. “But even modeling two dozen objects in a careful simulation, we could see there was a real effect that we could dig into.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team worked out the rate at which a primordial black hole should pass through the solar system, based on the amount of dark matter that is estimated to reside in a given region of space and the mass of a passing black hole, which in this case, they assumed to be as massive as the largest asteroids in the solar system, consistent with other astrophysical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primordial black holes do not live in the solar system. Rather, they’re streaming through the universe, doing their own thing,” says co-author Sarah Geller. “And the probability is, they’re going through the inner solar system at some angle once every 10 years or so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this rate, the researchers simulated various asteroid-mass black holes flying through the solar system, from various angles, and at velocities of about 150 miles per second. (The directions and speeds come from other studies of the distribution of dark matter throughout our galaxy.) They zeroed in on those flybys that appeared to be “close encounters,” or instances that caused some sort of effect in surrounding objects. They quickly found that any effect in the Earth or the moon was too uncertain to pin to a particular black hole. But Mars seemed to offer a clearer picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that if a primordial black hole were to pass within a few hundred million miles of Mars, the encounter would set off a “wobble,” or a slight deviation in Mars’ orbit. Within a few years of such an encounter, Mars’ orbit should shift by about a meter — an incredibly small wobble, given the planet is more than 140 million miles from Earth. And yet, this wobble could be detected by the various high-precision instruments that are monitoring Mars today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If such a wobble were detected in the next couple of decades, the researchers acknowledge there would still be much work needed to confirm that the push came from a passing black hole rather than a run-of-the-mill asteroid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need as much clarity as we can of the expected backgrounds, such as the typical speeds and distributions of boring space rocks, versus these primordial black holes,” Kaiser notes. “Luckily for us, astronomers have been tracking ordinary space rocks for decades as they have flown through our solar system, so we could calculate typical properties of their trajectories and begin to compare them with the very different types of paths and speeds that primordial black holes should follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with this, the researchers are exploring the possibility of a new collaboration with a group that has extensive expertise simulating many more objects in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are now working to simulate a huge number of objects, from planets to moons and rocks, and how they’re all moving over long time scales,” Geller says. “We want to inject close encounter scenarios, and look at their effects with higher precision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very neat test they’ve proposed, and it could tell us if the closest black hole is closer than we realize,” says Matt Caplan, associate professor of physics at Illinois State University, who was not involved in the study. “I should emphasize there’s a little bit of luck involved too. Whether or not a search finds a loud and clear signal depends on the exact path a wandering black hole takes through the solar system. Now that they’ve checked this idea with simulations, they have to do the hard part — checking the real data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. National Science Foundation, which includes an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences postdoctoral fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new study by MIT physicists proposes that a mysterious force known as early dark energy could solve two of the biggest puzzles in cosmology and fill in some major gaps in our understanding of how the early universe evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One puzzle in question is the “Hubble tension,” which refers to a mismatch in measurements of how fast the universe is expanding. The other involves observations of numerous early, bright galaxies that existed at a time when the early universe should have been much less populated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the MIT team has found that both puzzles could be resolved if the early universe had one extra, fleeting ingredient: early dark energy. Dark energy is an unknown form of energy that physicists suspect is driving the expansion of the universe today. Early dark energy is a similar, hypothetical phenomenon that may have made only a brief appearance, influencing the expansion of the universe in its first moments before disappearing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physicists have suspected that early dark energy could be the key to solving the Hubble tension, as the mysterious force could accelerate the early expansion of the universe by an amount that would resolve the measurement mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers have now found that early dark energy could also explain the baffling number of bright galaxies that astronomers have observed in the early universe. In their new study, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mnras/stae1932" target="_blank"&gt;reported today in the &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the team modeled the formation of galaxies in the universe’s first few hundred million years. When they incorporated a dark energy component only in that earliest sliver of time, they found the number of galaxies that arose from the primordial environment bloomed to fit astronomers’ observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;You have these two looming open-ended puzzles,” says study co-author Rohan Naidu, a postdoc in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “We find that in fact, early dark energy is a very elegant and sparse solution to two of the most pressing problems in cosmology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors include lead author and Kavli postdoc Xuejian (Jacob) Shen, and MIT professor of physics Mark Vogelsberger, along with&amp;nbsp;Michael Boylan-Kolchin at the University of Texas at Austin, and Sandro Tacchella at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big city lights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on standard cosmological and galaxy formation models, the universe should have taken its time spinning up the first galaxies. It would have taken billions of years for primordial gas to coalesce into galaxies as large and bright as the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2023, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) made a startling observation. With an ability to peer farther back in time than any observatory to date, the telescope uncovered a surprising number of bright galaxies as large as the modern Milky Way within the first 500 million years, when the universe was just 3 percent of its current age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bright galaxies that JWST saw would be like seeing a clustering of lights around big cities, whereas theory predicts something like the light around more rural settings like Yellowstone National Park,” Shen says. “And we don’t expect that clustering of light so early on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For physicists, the observations imply that there is either something fundamentally wrong with the physics underlying the models or a missing ingredient in the early universe that scientists have not accounted for. The MIT team explored the possibility of the latter, and whether the missing ingredient might be early dark energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists have proposed that early dark energy is a sort of antigravitational force that is turned on only at very early times. This force would counteract gravity’s inward pull and accelerate the early expansion of the universe, in a way that would resolve the mismatch in measurements. Early dark energy, therefore, is considered the most likely solution to the Hubble tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy skeleton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team explored whether early dark energy could also be the key to explaining the unexpected population of large, bright galaxies detected by JWST. In their new study, the physicists considered how early dark energy might affect the early structure of the universe that gave rise to the first galaxies. They focused on the formation of dark matter halos — regions of space where gravity happens to be stronger, and where matter begins to accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that dark matter halos are the invisible skeleton of the universe,” Shen explains. “Dark matter structures form first, and then galaxies form within these structures. So, we expect the number of bright galaxies should be proportional to the number of big dark matter halos.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed an empirical framework for early galaxy formation, which predicts the number, luminosity, and size of galaxies that should form in the early universe, given some measures of “cosmological parameters.”&amp;nbsp;Cosmological parameters are the basic ingredients, or mathematical terms, that describe the evolution of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists have determined that there are at least six main cosmological parameters, one of which is the Hubble constant — a term that describes the universe’s rate of expansion. Other parameters describe density fluctuations in the primordial soup, immediately after the Big Bang, from which dark matter halos eventually form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team reasoned that if early dark energy affects the universe’s early expansion rate, in a way that resolves the Hubble tension, then it could affect the balance of the other cosmological parameters, in a way that might increase the number of bright galaxies that appear at early times. To test their theory, they incorporated a model of early dark energy (the same one that happens to resolve the Hubble tension) into an empirical galaxy formation framework to see how the earliest dark matter structures evolve and give rise to the first galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we show is, the skeletal structure of the early universe is altered in a subtle way where the amplitude of fluctuations goes up, and you get bigger halos, and brighter galaxies that are in place at earlier times, more so than in our more vanilla models,” Naidu says. “It means things were more abundant, and more clustered in the early universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A priori, I would not have expected the abundance of JWST’s early bright galaxies to have anything to do with early dark energy, but their observation that EDE pushes cosmological parameters in a direction that boosts the early-galaxy abundance is interesting,” says Marc Kamionkowski, professor of theoretical physics at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved with the study. “I think more work will need to be done to establish a link between early galaxies and EDE, but regardless of how things turn out, it’s a clever — and hopefully ultimately fruitful — thing to try.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We demonstrated the potential of early dark energy as a unified solution to the two major issues faced by cosmology. This might be an evidence for its existence if the observational findings of JWST get further consolidated,” Vogelsberger concludes. “In the future, we can incorporate this into large cosmological simulations to see what detailed predictions we get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by NASA and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT PhD student Allan Shtofenmakher wants to keep space sustainable.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/keeping-cosmos-clean-allan-shtofenmakher-0905</guid>
        <dc:creator>Christine Thielman | Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Asked to describe his work for a lay audience, Allan Shtofenmakher responds with an unexpected question: “Have you ever seen the movie 'Wall-E?'” Recalling that the 2008 Disney-Pixar movie’s view of Earth from space was “brown and dusty and just surrounded by tons and tons of space junk,” he cautions, “If we’re not good stewards of our local space environment, we could actually end up in a situation like that — where we can’t get anything into space because it’s so cluttered and dirty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shtofenmakher, a PhD student, works in MIT’s Dynamics, Infrastructure Networks, and Mobility (DINaMo) research group under the guidance of Hamsa Balakrishnan, the William E. Leonhard Professor of aeronautics and astronautics (AeroAstro) and associate dean of MIT’s School of Engineering. “A lot of my work,” he continues, “is trying to keep space sustainable.” When satellites or spent rocket bodies crash into each other, they create space debris moving in different directions at very high speeds. “Then they’ll create even more junk that can crash into each other … and you end up with a completely unsustainable space environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shtofenmakher’s research interests reside at the intersection of space situational awareness and control of multi-agent systems, with a focus on tracking orbital debris using in-space satellite sensors. He is experimenting with techniques such as mixed-integer programming and multi-agent reinforcement learning to maximize our awareness of — and ability to avoid — rogue objects orbiting the Earth at speeds 10 times faster than a bullet. “My goal is to leverage the cameras on the thousands of active Earth-orbiting satellites to keep the space around Earth clean and sustainable for generations of space explorers to come,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from the University of California at Irvine, and a master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, Shtofenmakher worked as a spacecraft systems engineer on several small satellite programs. “I decided to return to graduate school to solve some of the challenges associated with distributed satellite networks,” he says, “and I chose MIT AeroAstro for its wealth of expertise in both satellite systems and multi-agent systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of my work had been broader and more general in aerospace engineering, and I wanted to become good at something. That something was controls and optimization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life-changing conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Shtofenmakher was originally applying to PhD programs, he says, “I wanted to work with actual spacecraft and hardware … on what are called CubeSats, which are these really small, student-built satellites that can be sent into space for cheap to do something cool and novel.” He received a call from Balakrishnan, whose research had focused primarily on air traffic control and optimization but was now shifting into space research. Reviewing his graduate school application, she thought Shtofenmakher’s expertise would be helpful in her lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What Hamsa specializes in (among other things) is multi-agent optimization,” he explains. “If you have a fleet of drones that are trying to simultaneously accomplish a bunch of different tasks, how do you distribute them in such a way that you minimize fuel across the fleet?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a different flavor of controls and optimization, he explains, than controlling individual CubeSats — but he is learning skills and using techniques that will enable him to work on applications on land (self-driving cars), in the air (autonomous drone networks), and in space (distributed satellite systems) when he completes his degree.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical fellowship support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his second year at MIT, Shtofenmakher was awarded an endowed fellowship in honor of the late Arthur Gelb ScD ’61, an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and former member of the MIT Corporation. “Getting the Art Gelb Fellowship,” he says, “meant that I suddenly had the flexibility to work on exactly what I wanted to work on.” Without the funding provided by the fellowship, he points out, he might have spent 20 hours a week working as a research assistant on an unrelated topic rather than dedicating his time to pursuing his own research interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shtofenmakher regrets that he never met Gelb, who passed away in 2023, because he sensed that they shared some common history: Both were the children of immigrants who worked hard and valued education. Growing up in California, he says, “My parents both worked more than full time so that we could finally land on our feet. I modeled my work ethic after theirs so that I could get a good education, which is the number one thing that they wanted for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work and life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still a hard worker, Shtofenmakher now also sees the value of work-life balance, serving as co-president of AeroAstro’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aeroastro-refs.mit.edu/what-we-do/"&gt;department Resources for Easing Friction and Stress&lt;/a&gt; (dREFS), through which he advocates for graduate student mental health and helps students establish healthy boundaries with their research advisors. With support from the department, he and classmates converted a storage area into the AeroAstro graduate student lounge, which now offers couches, a flat-screen TV to watch soccer and other events, and a place, he says, “where people can just chill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also adding to Shtofenmakher’s quality of life at MIT are sailing and skateboarding along the Charles River and spending time with fellow students. “I know I can just message any one of them, and we can walk to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ua.mit.edu/innovation/"&gt;Banana Lounge&lt;/a&gt;, or go down to the ping-pong table in the basement, or just grab food or drinks after work.” He has also developed an interest in bar tending, which aligns well with science. Mixology, he laughs, “is the closest I can get to art with my double left brain.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exoplanets form in protoplanetary disks, a collection of space dust and gas orbiting a star. The leading theory of planetary formation, called core accretion, occurs when grains of dust in the disk collect and grow to form a planetary core, like a snowball rolling downhill. Once it has a strong enough gravitational pull, other material collapses around it to form the atmosphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A secondary theory of planetary formation is gravitational collapse. In this scenario, the disk itself becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses to form the planet, like snow being plowed into a pile. This process requires the disk to be massive, and until recently there were no known viable candidates to observe; previous research had detected the snow pile, but not what made it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But in a new &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07877-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;paper published today in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, MIT Kerr-McGee Career Development Professor Richard Teague and his colleagues report evidence that the movement of the gas surrounding the star AB Aurigae behaves as one would expect in a gravitationally unstable disk, matching numerical predictions. Their finding is akin to detecting the snowplow that made the pile. This indicates that gravitational collapse is a viable method of planetary formation. Here, Teague, who studies the formation of planetary systems in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), answers a few questions about the new work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What made the AB Aurigae system a good candidate for observation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; There have been plenty of observations that have suggested some interesting dynamics going on the system. Groups have seen spiral arms within the disk; people have found hot spots, which some groups have interpreted as a planet; others have explained as some other instability. But it was really a disk that we knew there was lots of interesting motions going on. The data that we had previously was enough to see that it was interesting, but not really good enough to detail what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is gravitational instability when it comes to protoplanetary disks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Gravitational instabilities are where the gravity from the disk itself is strong enough to perturb motions within the disk. Usually, we assume that the gravitational potential is dominated by the central star, which is the case when the mass of the disk is less than 10 percent of the stellar mass (which is most of the time). When the disk mass gets too large, gravitational potential will affect it in different ways and drive these very large spiral arms in the disk. These can have lots of different effects: They can trap the gas, they can heat it up, they can allow for angular momentum to be transported very rapidly within the disk. If it&lt;ins cite="mailto:Richard%20Teague" datetime="2024-08-09T12:06"&gt;’&lt;/ins&gt;s unstable, the disk can fragment and collapse directly to form a planet in an incredibly short period of time. Rather than the tens of thousands of years that it would take for a core accretion to happen, this would happen at a fraction of that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How does this discovery challenge conventional wisdom around planetary formation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It shows that this alternative path of forming planets via direct collapse is a way that we can form planets. This is particularly important because we’re finding more and more evidence of very large planets — say, Jupiter mass or larger — that are sitting very far away from their star. Those sorts of planets are incredibly hard to form with core accretion, because you typically need them close to the star where things happen quickly. So to form something so massive, so far away from the star is a real challenge. If we're able to show that there are sources that are massive enough that they're gravitationally unstable, this solves that problem. It's a way that perhaps newer systems can be formed, because they've always been a bit of a challenge to understand how they came about with core accretion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>When the lights turned on in the universe</title>

  <description><![CDATA[By studying ancient, supermassive black holes called quasars, Dominika Ďurovčíková is illuminating an early moment when galaxies could first be observed.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Austin Chen | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Watching crowds of people hustle along Massachusetts Avenue from her window seat in MIT’s student center, Dominika Ďurovčíková has just one wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I would really like to do is convince a city to shut down their lights completely, apart from hospitals or whatever else needs them, just for an hour,” she says. “Let people see the Milky Way, or the stars. It influences you. You realize there’s something more than your everyday struggles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with a lifetime of gazing into the cosmos under her belt — with the last few years spent pursuing a PhD with professors Anna-Christina Eilers and Robert Simcoe at MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research — she still believes in the power of looking up at the night sky with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, however, she’s using tools a lot more powerful than that. The James Webb Space Telescope has begun providing rich data from bodies at the very edge of the universe, exactly where she wants to be looking. With data from the JSWT and the ground-based Magellan telescopes in Chile, Ďurovčíková is on the hunt for distant quasars — ancient, supermassive black holes that emit intense amounts of light — and the farther away they are, the more information they provide about the very early universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These objects are really, really bright, and that means that they’re really useful for studying the universe from very far away,” she says. “They’re like beacons from the past that you can still see, and they can tell you something about the universe at that stage. It’s almost like archaeology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent research has focused on what’s known as the Epoch of Reionization. It’s the period of time when the radiation from quasars, stars, galaxies and other light-emitting bodies were able to penetrate through the dark clouds of hydrogen atoms left over from the Big Bang, and shine their light through space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reionization was a phase transition where all the stuff around galaxies suddenly became transparent,” she says. “Finally, we could see light that was otherwise absorbed by neutral hydrogen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her goals is to help discover what caused the reionization process to start in the first place. While the astrophysical community has determined a loose time frame, there are many unanswered questions surrounding the Epoch of Reionization, and she hopes her quasar research can help solve some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The grand hope is that if you know the timing of reionization, that can inform you about the sources that caused it in the first place,” she says. “We’re not quite there, but looking at quasars could be a way to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time and distance on a cosmic scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quasars that Ďurovčíková has been most interested in are classified as “high-redshift.” Redshift is a measure of how much a wave’s frequency has decreased, and in an astrophysical context, it can be used to determine how long a wave of light has been traveling and how far away its source is, while accounting for the expansion of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher the redshift, the closer to the beginning of the universe you get,” Ďurovčíková explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that reionization began roughly 150 million years after the Big Bang, and approximately 850 million years after that, the dark hydrogen clouds that made up the “intergalactic medium,” or IGM, were fully ionized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her most recent paper, Ďurovčíková examined a set of 18 quasars whose light began traveling between approximately 770 million and 950 million years after the Big Bang. She and her collaborators, including scientists from four different countries, sorted the quasars into three “bins” based on distance, to compare the amount of neutral hydrogen in the IGM at different epochs. These amounts helped refine the timing of reionization and confirmed that data from quasars are consistent with data from other types of bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The story we have so far,” Ďurovčíková says, “is that at some point by redshift 5 or 6, the stuff in between galaxies was overall ionized. However, it’s not clear what type of star or what type of galaxy is more responsible for this global phase transition, which affected the whole universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closely related facet of her research — and one she’s planning on exploring further as she composes her thesis — is on how these quasars came to be in the first place. They’re so old, and so massive, that they challenge the current conceptions of how old the universe is. The light they generate comes from the immense gravitational force they exert on the plasma they absorb, and if they were already large enough to do that billions of years ago, just how long ago did they start forming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These black holes seem to be too massive to be grown in the time that their spectra seem to indicate,” she says. “Is there something in our way that’s obscuring the rest of the growth? We’re looking at different methods to measure their lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes towards the stars, feet grounded on Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Ďurovčíková is also working to encourage the next generation of astrophysicists. She says she was fortunate to have encouraging parents and mentors who showed her academic and career paths she hadn’t even considered, and she co-founded a nonprofit organization called Encouraging Women Across All Borders to do the same for students across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In your life, you will see a lot of doors,” she says. “There’s doors that you’ll see are open, and there’s doors you’ll see are closed. The biggest tragedy, though, is that there are so many doors that you don’t even know exist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She knows the feeling all too well. Growing up in Slovakia meant the primary options were attending university in either Bratislava, the capital, or Prague, in the neighboring Czech Republic. Her love of math and physics inspired her to enroll in the International Baccalaureate program, however, and it was in that program that she met a teacher, named&amp;nbsp;Eva Žitná, who “planted the seeds” that eventually sent her to Oxford for a four-year master’s program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just being in the IB program environment started to open up these possibilities I had not considered before,” she says. “Both my parents and I started talking to Žitná about how this could be an interesting possibility, and somehow one thing led to another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she takes great pleasure in guiding students along the same path she once took, equally as rewarding for her are the moments when she can see people realizing just how big the universe is. As a co-director of the MIT Astrogazers, she has witnessed many such moments. She remembers handing out eclipse glasses at the Cambridge Science Festival in preparation for last October’s partial solar eclipse, and recalls kids and adults alike with their necks craned upward, sharing the same look of wonder on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason I care is because we all get caught up in small things in life very easily,” she says. “The traffic sucks. The T isn’t working. Then, you look up at the sky and you realize there’s something much more beautiful and much bigger than all these little things.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Study: Rocks from Mars’ Jezero Crater, which likely predate life on Earth, contain signs of water</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024AV001241" target="_blank"&gt;new study appearing today in the journal &lt;em&gt;AGU Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at MIT and NASA report that seven rock samples collected along the “fan front” of Mars’ Jezero Crater contain minerals that are typically formed in water. The findings suggest that the rocks were originally deposited by water, or may have formed in the presence of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven samples were collected by NASA’s Perseverance rover in 2022 during its exploration of the crater’s western slope, where some rocks were hypothesized to have formed in what is now a dried-up ancient lake. Members of the Perseverance science team, including MIT scientists, have studied the rover’s images and chemical analyses of the samples, and confirmed that the rocks indeed contain signs of water, and that the crater was likely once a watery, habitable environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the crater was actually inhabited is yet unknown. The team found that the presence of organic matter — the starting material for life — cannot be confirmed, at least based on the rover’s measurements. But judging from the rocks’ mineral content, scientists believe the samples are their best chance of finding signs of ancient Martian life once the rocks are returned to Earth for more detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These rocks confirm the presence, at least temporarily, of habitable environments on Mars,” says the study’s lead author, Tanja Bosak, professor of geobiology in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). “What we’ve found is that indeed there was a lot of water activity. For how long, we don’t know, but certainly for long enough to create these big sedimentary deposits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, some of the collected samples may have originally been deposited in the ancient lake more than 3.5 billion years ago — before even the first signs of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the oldest rocks that may have been deposited by water, that we’ve ever laid hands or rover arms on,” says co-author Benjamin Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. “That’s exciting, because it means these are the most promising rocks that may have preserved fossils, and signatures of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include postdoc Eva Scheller, and research scientist Elias Mansbach, along with members of the Perseverance science team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the front&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rock samples were collected in 2022 as part of the rover’s Fan Front Campaign — an exploratory phase during which Perseverance traversed Jezero Crater’s western slope, where a fan-like region contains sedimentary, layered rocks. Scientists suspect that this “fan front” is an ancient delta that was created by sediment that flowed with a river and settled into a now bone-dry lakebed. If life existed on Mars, scientists believe that it could be preserved in the layers of sediment along the fan front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Perseverance collected seven samples from various locations along the fan front. The rover obtained each sample by drilling into the Martian bedrock and extracting a pencil-sized core, which it then sealed in a tube to one day be retrieved and returned to Earth for detailed analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to extracting the cores, the rover took images of the surrounding sediments at each of the seven locations. The science team then processed the imaging data to estimate a sediment’s average grain size and mineral composition. This analysis showed that all seven collected samples likely contain signs of water, suggesting that they were initially deposited by water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Bosak and her colleagues found evidence of certain minerals in the sediments that are known to precipitate out of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found lots of minerals like carbonates, which are what make reefs on Earth,” Bosak says. “And it’s really an ideal material that can preserve fossils of microbial life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers also identified sulfates in some samples that were collected at the base of the fan front. Sulfates are minerals that form in very salty water — another sign that water was present in the crater at one time — though very salty water, Bosak notes, “is not necessarily the best thing for life.” If the entire crater was once filled with very salty water, then it would be difficult for any form of life to thrive. But if only the bottom of the lake were briny, that could be an advantage, at least for preserving any signs of life that may have lived further up, in less salty layers, that eventually died and drifted down to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However salty it was, if there were any organics present, it's like pickling something in salt,” Bosak says. “If there was life that fell into the salty layer, it would be very well-preserved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuzzy fingerprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the team emphasizes that organic matter has not been confidently detected by the rover’s instruments. Organic matter can be signs of life, but can also be produced by certain geological processes that have nothing to do with living matter. Perseverance’s predecessor, the Curiosity rover, had detected organic matter throughout Mars’ Gale Crater, which scientists suspect may have come from asteroids that made impact with Mars in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a previous campaign, Perseverance detected what appeared to be organic molecules at multiple locations along Jezero Crater’s floor. These observations were taken by the rover’s Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) instrument, which uses ultraviolet light to scan the Martian surface. If organics are present, they can glow, similar to material under a blacklight. The wavelengths at which the material glows act as a sort of fingerprint for the kind of organic molecules that are present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Perseverance’s previous exploration of the crater floor, SHERLOC appeared to pick up signs of organic molecules throughout the region, and later, at some locations along the fan front. But a careful analysis, led by MIT’s Eva Scheller, has found that while the particular wavelengths observed could be signs of organic matter, they could just as well be signatures of substances that have nothing to do with organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that cerium metals incorporated in minerals actually produce very similar signals as the organic matter,” Scheller says. “When investigated, the potential organic signals were strongly correlated with phosphate minerals, which always contain some cerium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheller’s work shows that the rover’s measurements cannot be interpreted definitively as organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not bad news,” Bosak says. “It just tells us there is not very abundant organic matter. It’s still possible that it’s there. It’s just below the rover’s detection limit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the collected samples are finally sent back to Earth, Bosak says laboratory instruments will have more than enough sensitivity to detect any organic matter that might lie within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On Earth, once we have microscopes with nanometer-scale resolution, and various types of instruments that we cannot staff on one rover, then we can actually attempt to look for life,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the moon lacks any breathable air, it does host a barely-there atmosphere. Since the 1980s, astronomers have observed a very thin layer of atoms bouncing over the moon’s surface. This delicate atmosphere — technically known as an “exosphere” — is likely a product of some kind of space weathering. But exactly what those processes might be has been difficult to pin down with any certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at MIT and the University of Chicago say they have identified the main process that formed the moon’s atmosphere and continues to sustain it today. In a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm7074" target="_blank"&gt;study appearing today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team reports that the lunar atmosphere is primarily a product of “impact vaporization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers analyzed samples of lunar soil collected by astronauts during NASA’s Apollo missions. Their analysis suggests that over the moon’s 4.5-billion-year history its surface has been continuously bombarded, first by massive meteorites, then more recently, by smaller, dust-sized “micrometeoroids.” These constant impacts have kicked up the lunar soil, vaporizing certain atoms on contact and lofting the particles into the air. Some atoms are ejected into space, while others remain suspended over the moon, forming a tenuous atmosphere that is constantly replenished as meteorites continue to pelt the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that impact vaporization is the main process by which the moon has generated and sustained its extremely thin atmosphere over billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We give a definitive answer that meteorite impact vaporization is the dominant process that creates the lunar atmosphere,” says the study’s lead author, Nicole Nie, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “The moon is close to 4.5 billion years old, and through that time the surface has been continuously bombarded by meteorites. We show that eventually, a thin atmosphere reaches a steady state because it’s being continuously replenished by small impacts all over the moon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie’s co-authors are Nicolas Dauphas, Zhe Zhang, and Timo Hopp at the University of Chicago, and Menelaos Sarantos at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weathering’s roles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, NASA sent an orbiter around the moon to do some detailed atmospheric reconnaissance. The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE, pronounced “laddie”) was tasked with remotely gathering information about the moon’s thin atmosphere, surface conditions, and any environmental influences on the lunar dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LADEE’s mission was designed to determine the origins of the moon’s atmosphere. Scientists hoped that the probe’s remote measurements of soil and atmospheric composition might correlate with certain space weathering processes that could then explain how the moon’s atmosphere came to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suspect that two space weathering processes play a role in shaping the lunar atmosphere: impact vaporization and “ion sputtering” — a phenomenon involving solar wind, which carries energetic charged particles from the sun through space. When these particles hit the moon’s surface, they can transfer their energy to the atoms in the soil and send those atoms sputtering and flying into the air.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on LADEE’s data, it seemed both processes are playing a role,” Nie says. “For instance, it showed that during meteorite showers, you see more atoms in the atmosphere, meaning impacts have an effect. But it also showed that when the moon is shielded from the sun, such as during an eclipse, there are also changes in the atmosphere’s atoms, meaning the sun also has an impact. So, the results were not clear or quantitative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answers in the soil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To more precisely pin down the lunar atmosphere’s origins, Nie looked to samples of lunar soil collected by astronauts throughout NASA’s Apollo missions. She and her colleagues at the University of Chicago acquired 10 samples of lunar soil, each measuring about 100 milligrams — a tiny amount that she estimates would fit into a single raindrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie sought to first isolate two elements from each sample: potassium and rubidium. Both elements are “volatile,” meaning that they are easily vaporized by impacts and ion sputtering. Each element exists in the form of several isotopes. An isotope is a variation of the same element, that consists of the same number of protons but a slightly different number of neutrons. For instance, potassium can exist as one of three isotopes, each one having one more neutron, and there being slightly heavier than the last. Similarly, there are two isotopes of rubidium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team reasoned that if the moon’s atmosphere consists of atoms that have been vaporized and suspended in the air, lighter isotopes of those atoms should be more easily lofted, while heavier isotopes would be more likely to settle back in the soil. Furthermore, scientists predict that impact vaporization, and ion sputtering, should result in very different isotopic proportions in the soil. The specific ratio of light to heavy isotopes that remain in the soil, for both potassium and rubidium, should then reveal the main process contributing to the lunar atmosphere’s origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, Nie analyzed the Apollo samples by first crushing the soils into a fine powder, then dissolving the powders in acids to purify and isolate solutions containing potassium and rubidium. She then passed these solutions through a mass spectrometer to measure the various isotopes of both potassium and rubidium in each sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the team found that the soils contained mostly heavy isotopes of both potassium and rubidium.&amp;nbsp;The researchers were able to quantify the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of both potassium and rubidium, and by comparing both elements, they found that impact vaporization was most likely the dominant process by which atoms are vaporized and lofted to form the moon’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With impact vaporization, most of the atoms would stay in the lunar atmosphere, whereas with ion sputtering, a lot of atoms would be ejected into space,” Nie says. “From our study, we now can quantify the role of both processes, to say that the relative contribution of impact vaporization versus ion sputtering is about 70:30 or larger.” In other words, 70 percent or more of the moon’s atmosphere is a product of meteorite impacts, whereas the remaining 30 percent is a consequence of the solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of such a subtle effect is remarkable, thanks to the innovative idea of combining potassium and rubidium isotope measurements along with careful, quantitative modeling,” says Justin Hu, a postdoc who studies lunar soils at Cambridge University, who was not involved in the study. “This discovery goes beyond understanding the&amp;nbsp;moon’s history, as such processes could occur and might be more significant on other moons and asteroids, which are the focus of many planned return missions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without these Apollo samples, we would not be able to get precise data and measure quantitatively to understand things in more detail,” Nie says. “It’s important for us to bring samples back from the moon and other planetary bodies, so we can draw clearer pictures of the solar system’s formation and evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by NASA and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The launch of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2021 kicked off an exciting new era for exoplanet research, especially for scientists looking at terrestrial planets orbiting stars other than our sun. But three years into the telescope’s mission, some scientists have run into challenges that have slowed down progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02298-5"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the TRAPPIST-1 JWST Community Initiative lays out a step-by-step roadmap to overcome the challenges they faced while studying the TRAPPIST-1 system by improving the efficiency of data gathering to benefit the astronomy community at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A whole community of experts came together to tackle these complex cross-disciplinary challenges to design the first multiyear observational strategy to give JWST a fighting chance at identifying habitable worlds over its lifetime,” says Julien de Wit, an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) and one of the lead authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-for-one deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located 41 light years from Earth, the TRAPPIST-1 system with its seven planets presents a unique opportunity to study a large system with multiple planets of different compositions, similar to our own solar system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a dream target: You have not one, but maybe three, planets in the habitable zone, so you have a way to actually compare in the same system,” says René Doyon from the Université de Montréal, who co-led the study with de Wit. “There are only a handful of well-characterized temperate rocky planets for which we can hope to detect their atmosphere, and most of them are within the TRAPPIST-1 system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers like de Wit and Doyon study exoplanet atmospheres through a technique called transmission spectroscopy, where they look at the way starlight passes through a planet’s potential atmosphere to see what elements are present. Transmission spectra are collected when the planet passes in front of its host star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planets within the TRAPPIST system have short orbital periods. As a result, their transits frequently overlap. Transit observation times are usually allotted in five-hour windows, and when scheduled properly, close to half of these can catch at least two transits. This “two-for-one” saves both time and money while doubling data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stellar contamination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stars are not uniform; their surfaces can vary in temperature, creating spots that can be hotter or cooler. Molecules like water vapor can condense in cool spots and interfere with transmission spectra. Stellar information like this can be difficult to disentangle from the planetary signal and give false indications of a planet’s atmospheric composition, creating what’s known as “stellar contamination.” While it has often been ignored, the improved capabilities of the JWST have revealed the challenges stellar contamination introduces when studying planetary atmospheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EAPS research scientist Ben Rackham ran into these challenges when they derailed his initial PhD research on small exoplanets using the Magellan Telescopes in Chile. He’s now seeing the same problem he first encountered as a graduate student repeating itself with the new JWST data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we predicted from that earlier work with data from ground-based telescopes, the very first spectral signatures we're getting with JWST don't really make any sense in terms of a planetary interpretation,” he says. “The features are not what we would expect to see, and they change from transit to transit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rackham and David Berardo, a postdoc in EAPS, have been working with de Wit on ways to correct for stellar contamination using two different methods: improving models of stellar spectra and using &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad1b5b"&gt;direct observations to derive corrections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By observing a star as it rotates, we can use the sensitivity of JWST to get a clearer picture of what its surface looks like, allowing for a more accurate measuring of the atmosphere of planets that transit it,” says Berardo. This, combined with studying back-to-back transits as proposed in the roadmap, collects useful data on the star that can be used to filter out stellar contamination from both future studies and past ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond TRAPPIST-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current roadmap was born from the efforts of the TRAPPIST JWST Community Initiative to bring together separate programs focused on individual planets, which prevented them from leveraging the optimal transit observation windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We understood early on that this effort would 'take a village' to avoid the efficiency traps of small observation programs&lt;ins cite="mailto:Benjamin%20Vern%20Rackham" datetime="2024-07-11T12:23"&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt;” says de Wit. “Our hope now is that a large-scale community effort guided by the roadmap can be initiated to yield deliverables at a timely pace.” De Wit hopes that it could result in identifying habitable, or inhabitable, worlds around TRAPPIST-1 within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both de Wit and Doyon believe that the TRAPPIST-1 system is the best place for conducting fundamental research on exoplanet atmospheres that will extend to studies in other systems. Doyon thinks that “the TRAPPIST-1 system will be useful not only for TRAPPIST-1 itself, but also to learn how to do very precise correction of stellar activity which will be beneficial to many other transmission spectroscopy programs also affected by stellar activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have within reach fundamental and transforming answers with a clear roadmap to them,” says de Wit. “We just need to follow it diligently.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hot Jupiters are some of the most extreme planets in the galaxy. These scorching worlds are as massive as Jupiter, and they swing wildly close to their star, whirling around in a few days compared to our own gas giant’s leisurely 4,000-day orbit around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suspect, though, that hot Jupiters weren’t always so hot and in fact may have formed as “cold Jupiters,” in more frigid, distant environs. But how they evolved to be the star-hugging gas giants that astronomers observe today is a big unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, astronomers at MIT, Penn State University, and elsewhere have discovered a hot Jupiter “progenitor” — a sort of juvenile planet that is in the midst of becoming a hot Jupiter. And its orbit is providing some answers to how hot Jupiters evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet, which astronomers labeled&amp;nbsp;TIC 241249530 b, orbits a star that is about 1,100 light-years from Earth. The planet circles its star in a highly “eccentric” orbit, meaning that it comes extremely close to the star before slinging far out, then doubling back, in a narrow, elliptical circuit. If the planet was part of our solar system, it would come 10 times closer to the sun than Mercury, before hurtling out, just past Earth, then back around. By the scientists’ estimates, the planet’s stretched-out orbit has the highest eccentricity of any planet detected to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet’s orbit is also unique in its “retrograde” orientation. Unlike the Earth and other planets in the solar system, which orbit in the same direction as the sun spins, the new planet travels in a direction that is counter to its star’s rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran simulations of orbital dynamics and found that the planet’s highly eccentric and retrograde orbit are signs that it is likely evolving into a hot Jupiter, through “high-eccentricity migration” — a process by which a planet’s orbit wobbles and progressively shrinks as it interacts with another star or planet on a much wider orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of&amp;nbsp;TIC 241249530 b, the researchers determined that the planet orbits around a primary star that itself orbits around a secondary star, as part of a stellar binary system. The interactions between the two orbits — of the planet and its star — have caused the planet to gradually migrate closer to its star over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planet’s orbit is currently elliptical in shape, and the planet takes about 167 days to complete a lap around its star. The researchers predict that in 1 billion years, the planet will migrate into a much tighter, circular orbit, when it will then circle its star every few days. At that point, the planet will have fully evolved into a hot Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new planet supports the theory that high eccentricity migration should account for some fraction of hot Jupiters,” says Sarah Millholland, assistant professor of physics in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “We think that when this planet formed, it would have been a frigid world. And because of the dramatic orbital dynamics, it will become a hot Jupiter in about a billion years, with temperatures of several thousand kelvin. So it’s a huge shift from where it started.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millholland and her colleagues have published their findings today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. Her co-authors are MIT undergraduate Haedam Im, lead author Arvind Gupta of Penn State University and NSF NOIRLab, and collaborators at multiple other universities, institutions, and observatories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Radical seasons”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet was first spotted in data taken by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an MIT-led mission that monitors the brightness of nearby stars for “transits,” or brief dips in starlight that could signal the presence of a planet passing in front of, and temporarily blocking, a star’s light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 12, 2020, TESS picked up a possible transit of the star&amp;nbsp;TIC 241249530. Gupta and his colleagues at Penn State determined that the transit was consistent with a Jupiter-sized planet crossing in front of the star. They then acquired measurements from other observatories of the star’s radial velocity, which estimates a star’s wobble, or the degree to which it moves back and forth, in response to other nearby objects that might gravitationally tug on the star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those measurements confirmed that a Jupiter-sized planet was orbiting the star and that its orbit was highly eccentric, bringing the planet extremely close to the star before flinging it far out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this detection, astronomers had known of only one other planet, HD 80606 b, that was thought to be an early hot Jupiter. That planet, discovered in 2001, held the record for having the highest eccentricity, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new planet experiences really dramatic changes in starlight throughout its orbit,” Millholland says. “There must be really radical seasons and an absolutely scorched atmosphere every time it passes close to the star.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Dance of orbits”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could a planet have fallen into such an extreme orbit? And how might its eccentricity evolve over time? For answers, Im and Millholland ran simulations of planetary orbital dynamics to model how the planet may have evolved throughout its history and how it might carry on over hundreds of millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team modeled the gravitational interactions between the planet, its star, and the second nearby star. Gupta and his colleagues had observed that the two stars orbit each other in a binary system, while the planet is simultaneously orbiting the closer star. The configuration of the two orbits is somewhat like a circus performer twirling a hula hoop around her waist, while spinning a second hula hoop around her wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millholland and Im ran multiple simulations, each with a different set of starting conditions, to see which condition, when run forward over several billions of years, produced the configuration of planetary and stellar orbits that Gupta’s team observed in the present day. They then ran the best match even further into the future to predict how the system will evolve over the next several billion years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simulations revealed that the new planet is likely in the midst of evolving into a hot Jupiter: Several billion years ago, the planet formed as a cold Jupiter, far from its star, in a region cold enough to condense and take shape. Newly formed, the planet likely orbited the star in a circular path. This conventional orbit, however, gradually stretched and grew eccentric, as it experienced gravitational forces from the star’s misaligned orbit with its second, binary star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a pretty extreme process in that the changes to the planet’s orbit are massive,” Millholland says. “It’s a big dance of orbits that’s happening over billions of years, and the planet’s just going along for the ride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another billion years, the simulations show that the planet’s orbit will stabilize in a close-in, circular path around its star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then, the planet will fully become a hot Jupiter,” Millholland says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s observations, along with their simulations of the planet’s evolution, support the theory that hot Jupiters can form through high eccentricity migration, a process by which a planet gradually moves into place via extreme changes to its orbit over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear not only from this, but other statistical studies too, that high eccentricity migration should account for some fraction of hot Jupiters,” Millholland notes. “This system highlights how incredibly diverse exoplanets can be. They are mysterious other worlds that can have wild orbits that tell a story of how they got that way and where they’re going. For this planet, it’s not quite finished its journey yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really hard to catch these hot Jupiter progenitors ‘in the act’ as they undergo their super eccentric episodes, so it is very exciting to find a system that undergoes this process,” says Smadar Naoz, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California at Los Angeles, who was not involved with the study. “I believe that this discovery opens the door to a deeper understanding of the birth configuration of the exoplanetary system.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Satellite density in Earth’s orbit has increased exponentially in recent years, with lower costs of small satellites allowing governments, researchers, and private companies to launch and operate some 2,877 satellites into orbit in 2023 alone. This includes increased geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite activity, which brings technologies with global-scale impact, from broadband internet to climate surveillance. Along with the manifold benefits of these satellite-enabled technologies, however, come increased safety and security risks, as well as environmental concerns. More accurate and efficient methods of monitoring and modeling satellite behavior are urgently needed to prevent collisions and other disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To address this challenge, the MIT Astrodynamics, Space Robotic, and Controls Laboratory (ARCLab) launched the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2164/overview"&gt;MIT ARCLab Prize for AI Innovation in Space&lt;/a&gt;: a first-of-its-kind competition asking contestants to harness AI to characterize satellites’ patterns of life (PoLs) — the long-term behavioral narrative of a satellite in orbit — using purely passively collected information. Following the call for participants last fall, 126 teams used machine learning to create algorithms to label and time-stamp the behavioral modes of GEO satellites over a six-month period, competing for accuracy and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With support from the U.S. Department of the Air Force-MIT AI Accelerator, the challenge offers a total of $25,000. A team of judges from ARCLab and MIT Lincoln Laboratory evaluated the submissions based on clarity, novelty, technical depth, and reproducibility, assigning each entry a score out of 100 points. Now the judges have announced the winners and runners-up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First prize:&amp;nbsp;David Baldsiefen — Team Hawaii2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With a winning score of 96, Baldsiefen will be awarded $10,000 and is invited to join the ARCLab team in presenting at a poster session at the&amp;nbsp;Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies (AMOS) Conference in Hawaii this fall. One evaluator noted, “Clear and concise report, with very good ideas such as the label encoding of the localizer. Decisions on the architectures and the feature engineering are well reasoned. The code provided is also well documented and structured, allowing an easy reproducibility of the experimentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second prize:&amp;nbsp;Binh Tran, Christopher Yeung, Kurtis Johnson, Nathan Metzger — Team Millennial-IUP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With a score of 94.2, Y, Millennial-IUP will be awarded $5,000 and will also join the ARCLab team at the AMOS conference. One evaluator said, “The models chosen were sensible and justified, they made impressive efforts in efficiency gains… They used physics to inform their models and this appeared to be reproducible. Overall it was an easy to follow, concise report without much jargon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third Prize: Isaac Haik and Francois Porcher — Team QR_Is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With a score of 94, Haik and Porcher will share the third prize of $3,000 and will also be invited to the AMOS conference with the ARCLab team. One evaluator noted, “This informative and interesting report describes the combination of ML and signal processing techniques in a compelling way, assisted by informative plots, tables, and sequence diagrams. The author identifies and describes a modular approach to class detection and their assessment of feature utility, which they correctly identify is not evenly useful across classes… Any lack of mission expertise is made up for by a clear and detailed discussion of the benefits and pitfalls of the methods they used and discussion of what they learned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fourth- through seventh-place scoring teams will each receive $1,000 and a certificate of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The goal of this competition was to foster an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving in the space domain by inviting AI development experts to apply their skills in this new context of orbital capacity. And all of our winning teams really delivered — they brought technical skill, novel approaches, and expertise to a very impressive round of submissions.” says Professor Richard Linares, who heads ARCLab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active modeling with passive data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Throughout a GEO satellite’s time in orbit, operators issue commands to place them in various behavioral modes—station-keeping, longitudinal shifts, end-of-life behaviors, and so on. Satellite Patterns of Life (PoLs) describe on-orbit behavior composed of sequences of both natural and non-natural behavior modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;ARCLab has developed a groundbreaking benchmarking tool for geosynchronous satellite pattern-of-life characterization and created the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/arclab/research/geosynchronous-satellite-pattern-of-life-characterization/"&gt;Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification Dataset&lt;/a&gt; (SPLID), comprising real and synthetic space object data. The challenge participants used this tool to create algorithms that use AI to map out the on-orbit behaviors of a satellite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The goal of the MIT ARCLab Prize for AI Innovation in Space is to encourage technologists and enthusiasts to bring innovation and new skills sets to well-established challenges in aerospace. The team aims to hold the competition in 2025 and 2026 to explore other topics and invite experts in AI to apply their skills to new challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During the journey from the suburbs to the city, the tree canopy often dwindles down as skyscrapers rise up. A group of &lt;a href="https://neiacademy.org/"&gt;New England Innovation Academy&lt;/a&gt; students wondered why that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Our friend Victoria noticed that where we live in Marlborough there are lots of trees in our own backyards. But if you drive just 30 minutes to Boston, there are almost no trees,” said high school junior Ileana Fournier. “We were struck by that duality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This inspired Fournier and her classmates Victoria Leeth and Jessie Magenyi to prototype a mobile app that illustrates Massachusetts deforestation trends for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://dayofai.org/"&gt;Day of AI&lt;/a&gt;, a free, hands-on curriculum developed by the MIT Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE) initiative, headquartered in the MIT Media Lab and in collaboration with the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MIT Open Learning. They were among a group of 20 students from New England Innovation Academy who shared their projects during the 2024 Day of AI&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7d3bBjqJGJ0?si=flSZyq37YHfBJGkY&amp;amp;t=371"&gt;global celebration hosted with the Museum of Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.dayofai.org/curriculum"&gt;Day of AI curriculum&lt;/a&gt; introduces K-12 students to artificial intelligence. Now in its third year, Day of AI enables students to improve their communities and collaborate on larger global challenges using AI. Fournier, Leeth, and Magenyi’s TreeSavers app falls under the Telling Climate Stories with Data module, one of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://dayofai.org/new-courses-on-data-science-climate-change/"&gt;four new climate-change-focused lessons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We want you to be able to express yourselves creatively to use AI to solve problems with critical-thinking skills,” Cynthia Breazeal, director of MIT RAISE, dean for digital learning at MIT Open Learning, and professor of media arts and sciences, said during this year’s Day of AI global celebration at the Museum of Science. “We want you to have an ethical and responsible way to think about this really powerful, cool, and exciting technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving from understanding to action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Day of AI invites students to examine the intersection of AI and various disciplines, such as history, civics, computer science, math, and climate change. With the curriculum available year-round, more than 10,000 educators across 114 countries have brought Day of AI activities to their classrooms and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The curriculum gives students the agency to evaluate local issues and invent meaningful solutions. “We’re thinking about how to create tools that will allow kids to have direct access to data and have a personal connection that intersects with their lived experiences,” Robert Parks, curriculum developer at MIT RAISE, said at the Day of AI global celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Before this year, first-year Jeremie Kwapong said he knew very little about AI. “I was very intrigued,” he said. “I started to experiment with ChatGPT to see how it reacts. How close can I get this to human emotion? What is AI’s knowledge compared to a human’s knowledge?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to helping students spark an interest in AI literacy, teachers around the world have told MIT RAISE that they want to use data science lessons to engage students in conversations about climate change. Therefore, Day of AI’s new hands-on projects use weather and climate change to show students why it’s important to develop a critical understanding of dataset design and collection when observing the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There is a lag between cause and effect in everyday lives,” said Parks. “Our goal is to demystify that, and allow kids to access data so they can see a long view of things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tools like MIT App Inventor — which allows anyone to create a mobile application — help students make sense of what they can learn from data. Fournier, Leeth, and Magenyi programmed TreeSavers in App Inventor to chart regional deforestation rates across Massachusetts, identify ongoing trends through statistical models, and predict environmental impact. The students put that “long view” of climate change into practice when developing TreeSavers’ interactive maps. Users can toggle between Massachusetts’s current tree cover, historical data, and future high-risk areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although AI provides fast answers, it doesn’t necessarily offer equitable solutions, said David Sittenfeld, director of the Center for the Environment at the Museum of Science. The Day of AI curriculum asks students to make decisions on sourcing data, ensuring unbiased data, and thinking responsibly about how findings could be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There’s an ethical concern about tracking people’s data,” said Ethan Jorda, a New England Innovation Academy student. His group used open-source data to program an app that helps users track and reduce their carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM Learning at the Museum of Science, believes students are prepared to use AI responsibly to make the world a better place. “They can see themselves shaping the world they live in,” said Cunningham. “Moving through from understanding to action, kids will never look at a bridge or a piece of plastic lying on the ground in the same way again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepening collaboration on earth and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2024 Day of AI speakers emphasized collaborative problem solving at the local, national, and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Through different ideas and different perspectives, we’re going to get better solutions,” said Cunningham. “How do we start young enough that every child has a chance to both understand the world around them but also to move toward shaping the future?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Presenters from MIT, the Museum of Science, and NASA approached this question with a common goal — expanding STEM education to learners of all ages and backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have been delighted to collaborate with the MIT RAISE team to bring this year’s Day of AI celebration to the Museum of Science,” says Meg Rosenburg, manager of operations at the Museum of Science Centers for Public Science Learning. “This opportunity to highlight the new climate modules for the curriculum not only perfectly aligns with the museum’s goals to focus on climate and active hope throughout our Year of the Earthshot initiative, but it has also allowed us to bring our teams together and grow a relationship that we are very excited to build upon in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rachel Connolly, systems integration and analysis lead for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/sciact-team/mit-media-lab/"&gt;NASA's Science Activation Program&lt;/a&gt;, showed the power of collaboration with the example of how human comprehension of Saturn’s appearance has evolved. From Galileo’s early telescope to the Cassini space probe, modern imaging of Saturn represents 400 years of science, technology, and math working together to further knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Technologies, and the engineers who built them, advance the questions we’re able to ask and therefore what we’re able to understand,” said Connolly, research scientist at MIT Media Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;New England Innovation Academy students saw an opportunity for collaboration a little closer to home. Emmett Buck-Thompson, Jeff Cheng, and Max Hunt envisioned a social media app to connect volunteers with local charities. Their project was inspired by Buck-Thompson’s father’s difficulties finding volunteering opportunities, Hunt’s role as the president of the school’s Community Impact Club, and Cheng’s aspiration to reduce screen time for social media users. Using MIT App Inventor, ​their combined ideas led to a prototype with the potential to make a real-world impact in their community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Day of AI curriculum teaches the mechanics of AI, ethical considerations and responsible uses, and interdisciplinary applications for different fields. It also empowers students to become creative problem solvers and engaged citizens in their communities and online. From supporting volunteer efforts to encouraging action for the state’s forests to tackling the global challenge of climate change, today’s students are becoming tomorrow’s leaders with Day of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We want to empower you to know that this is a tool you can use to make your community better, to help people around you with this technology,” said Breazeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other Day of AI speakers included Tim Ritchie, president of the Museum of Science; Michael Lawrence Evans, program director of the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics; Dava Newman, director of the MIT Media Lab; and Natalie Lao, executive director of the App Inventor Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new MIT course this spring asked students to design what humans might need to comfortably work in and inhabit space. The time for these creations is now. While the NASA Apollo missions saw astronauts land on the moon, collect samples, and return home, the missions planned under Artemis, NASA’s current moon exploration program, include establishing long-term bases in orbit as well as on the surface of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-disciplinary design course MAS.S66/4.154/16.89 (Space Architectures) was run in parallel with the departments of Architecture, and Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro), and the MIT Media Lab’s Space Exploration Initiatives group. Thirty-five students from across the Institute registered to imagine, design, prototype, and test what might be needed to support human habitation and activities on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course’s popularity was not surprising to the instructors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A&amp;nbsp;lot of students at MIT are excited about space,” says&amp;nbsp;Jeffrey Hoffman, one of the course instructors and professor of the practice in AeroAstro. Before teaching at MIT, Hoffman was a NASA astronaut who flew five missions aboard the space shuttle.&amp;nbsp;“Certainly in AeroAstro, half the students want to be astronauts eventually, so it’s not like they hadn’t thought about living in space before. This was an opportunity to use that inspiration and work on a project that might become an actual design for real lunar habitats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT’s history with NASA, and with&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/behind-scenes-apollo-mission-0718"&gt;Apollo missions&lt;/a&gt; in particular, is well documented. NASA’s first major contract for the Apollo program was awarded to MIT in 1961. Dava Newman, director of the MIT Media Lab and former NASA deputy administrator, was also a course instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing students for the next phase of working and living in space was the goal of this class. In addition to the Artemis missions, the rise of commercial spaceflight foretells the need to investigate these designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT Architecture has always succeeded best at the intersection of research and practice,” says Nicholas de Monchaux, a course instructor and architecture department head. “With more and more designers being called on to design for extreme environments and conditions — including space — we see an important opportunity for research, collaboration, and new forms of practice, including an ongoing collaboration with the Media Lab and AeroAstro on designing for extreme environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing lunar habitats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defining aspect of the class is the blend of architecture and engineering students. &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/courses/mas-s66/"&gt;Each group&lt;/a&gt; brought different mindsets and approaches to the questions and challenges put before them. Shared activities, guest lectures, and a week touring NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; the SpaceX launch facility in Brownsville, Texas; and ICON’s 3D printing facilities for construction in Austin, Texas, provided the students with an introduction to teams already working in this field. Paramount among their lessons: an understanding of the harsh environments for which they will be designing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman doesn’t sugarcoat what life in space is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Space is one of the most hostile environments you can imagine,” he says. “You're sitting inside a spacecraft looking out the window, realizing that on the other side of that window, I'd be dead in a few seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students were divided into seven teams to develop their projects, and the value of collaboration quickly became apparent. The teams began with a concept phase where the visions of the architects — whose impulse was to create a comfortable and livable habitat — sometimes conflicted with those of the engineers, who were more focused on the realities of the extreme environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflatable designs emerged in several projects: a modular inflatable mobile science library that could support up to four people; an inflatable habitat that can be deployed within minutes to provide short-term shelter and protection for a crew on the moon; and a semi-permanent in situ habitat for space exploration ahead of an established lunar base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a common language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Architects and engineers tend to approach the design process differently,” says Annika Thomas, a mechanical engineering doctoral student and member of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/lunar-bricks/overview/"&gt;MoonBRICCS team&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;“While it was a challenge to integrate these ideas early on, we found ways over time to communicate and coordinate our ideas, brought together by a common vision for the end of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas’s teammates, architecture students Juan Daniel Hurtado Salazar and&amp;nbsp;Mikita Klimenka, say that technical considerations in architecture are often resolved toward the middle and end of a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gives us too much space to put off the implications of our design decisions while leaving little time to resolve them,” says Salazar.&amp;nbsp;“The insight of our engineers challenged every design decision from the onset with mechanical, economic, and technological implications of current space technology and material regimes. It also provided a fruitful arena to cooperatively discuss the concern that the most materially and economically optimal solutions are not always the most culturally or morally justified, as the emergence of long-term habitats brings the full gamut of an astronaut’s functional, social, and emotional needs to the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Klimenka, “The wealth of knowledge and experience present within the team allowed us to meaningfully consider possible responses to producing a viable long-term habitat. While navigating both engineering and design constraints certainly required additional effort, the thinking process overall was extremely refreshing as we exposed ourselves to totally different sets of challenges that we do not typically deal with in our domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture graduate student&amp;nbsp;Kaicheng Zhuang, who worked with engineers on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/lunar-sandbags/overview/"&gt;Lunar Sandbags project&lt;/a&gt;, says communication skills were “crucial” to the team working successfully together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the engineers, it’s essential to focus on the technical feasibility and practical implementation, making sure every design element can be realistically achieved,” says Zhuang.&amp;nbsp;“They needed clear, precise information about structural integrity, material properties, and functionality. On the other hand, within our architecture team, discussions often revolve around the conceptual and aesthetic aspects, such as the visual impact, spatial dynamics, and user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly Johnson, an AeroAstro graduate student and team member on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/expandable-rv/overview/"&gt;lunarNOMAD project&lt;/a&gt;, concurs. “Traditionally, for a systems engineer such as myself it is easy to wave away the small design details and say they'll be addressed without going into detail about&amp;nbsp;how&amp;nbsp;they'll be addressed. The architects brought in a new level of detail that helped clarify our intentions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/articles/momo-a-self-assembling-lunar-habitat-featured-in-designboom/"&gt;Momo: a Self-Assembling Lunar Habitat&lt;/a&gt; created a mission profile for their design. The semi-permanent in situ habitat was designed for space exploration ahead of establishing a permanent base on the moon. The module is flexible enough to fold nearly flat for easy transport. Their project was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.designboom.com/technology/momo-self-assembling-lunar-habitat-mit-media-lab-05-26-2024/"&gt;recently profiled&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;DesignBoom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final projects showed the vast differences among the teams despite there being a “limited number of ways that you can actually keep people alive on the lunar surface,” says&amp;nbsp;Cody Paige,&amp;nbsp;director of Space Exploration Initiatives and a course instructor. Students needed to consider what types of materials were needed; how these would be transported and assembled; how long their structures would remain functional; and what social or human experience would be supported, among other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hands-on experience to create life-size models was especially important in this course given that AI is becoming a larger component of so many tasks and areas of decision-making, according to Paige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A computer doesn’t always translate exactly into the real world, and so having the students make prototypes shows them that there is a lot of benefit in understanding the materials you’re working with, how they function in real life, and the tactile ability that you can gather by working with these materials,” says Paige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As fantastical as some of the projects appeared — with their combination of architecture, engineering, and design — they may very well be viable soon, especially as more architects are hired to design for space and students are understanding the landscape and needs for the demanding environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to train our students to be the pioneers at the forefront of this field,” says&amp;nbsp;Skylar Tibbits, a professor in the architecture department and one of the course instructors. “The longer astronauts are in space or on the moon, we need to be designing habitats for human experiences that people will want to live in for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for architects and engineers skilled in this specific field is thriving. Thomas — the engineering student on the MoonBRICCS team — is currently working on robotics for space application. Her teammate — Palak Patel — is an engineering doctoral student working on extreme environment materials for space applications. With the enthusiasm of the students, as well as the considerable real-world occupational need, the three academic units plan to continue to offer the course in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see extending this into a multi-year program in designing for extreme environments — in space and on Earth —&amp;nbsp;and are actively discussing sponsorships and partnerships,” says de Monchaux.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, is the only planetary body in the solar system besides our own that currently hosts active rivers, lakes, and seas. Titan’s otherworldly river systems are thought to be filled with liquid methane and ethane that flows into wide lakes and seas, some as large as the Great Lakes on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of Titan’s large seas and smaller lakes was confirmed in 2007, with images taken by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft. Since then, scientists have pored over those and other images for clues to the moon’s mysterious liquid environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT geologists have studied Titan’s shorelines and shown through simulations that the moon’s large seas have likely been shaped by waves. Until now, scientists have found indirect and conflicting signs of wave activity, based on remote images of Titan’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team took a different approach to investigate the presence of waves on Titan, by first modeling the ways in which a lake can erode on Earth. They then applied their modeling to Titan’s seas to determine what form of erosion could have produced the shorelines in Cassini’s images. Waves, they found, were the most likely explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that their results are not definitive; to confirm that there are waves on Titan will require direct observations of wave activity on the moon’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can say, based on our results, that if the coastlines of Titan’s seas have eroded, waves are the most likely culprit,” says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. “If we could stand at the edge of one of Titan’s seas, we might see waves of liquid methane and ethane lapping on the shore and crashing on the coasts during storms. And they would be capable of eroding the material that the coast is made of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perron and his colleagues, including first author Rose Palermo PhD ’22, a former MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduate student and current research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn4192" target="_blank"&gt;published their study today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. Their co-authors include MIT Research Scientist Jason Soderblom; former MIT postdoc Sam Birch, now an assistant professor at Brown University; Andrew Ashton at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; and Alexander Hayes of Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Taking a different tack”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of waves on Titan has been a somewhat controversial topic ever since Cassini spotted bodies of liquid on the moon’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people who tried to see evidence for waves didn’t see any, and said, ‘These seas are mirror-smooth,’” Palermo says. “Others said they did see some roughness on the liquid surface but weren’t sure if waves caused it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing whether Titan’s seas host wave activity could give scientists information about the moon’s climate, such as the strength of the winds that could whip up such waves. Wave information could also help scientists predict how the shape of Titan’s seas might evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than look for direct signs of wave-like features in images of Titan, Perron says the team had to “take a different tack,&amp;nbsp;and see, just by looking at the shape of the shoreline, if we could tell what’s been eroding the coasts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titan’s seas are thought to have formed as rising levels of liquid flooded a landscape crisscrossed by river valleys. The researchers zeroed in on three scenarios for what could have happened next: no coastal erosion; erosion driven by waves; and “uniform erosion,” driven either by “dissolution,” in which liquid passively dissolves a coast’s material, or a mechanism in which the coast gradually sloughs off under its own weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers simulated how various shoreline shapes would evolve under each of the three scenarios. To simulate wave-driven erosion, they took into account a variable known as “fetch,” which describes the physical distance from one point on a shoreline to the opposite side of a lake or sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wave erosion is driven by the height and angle of the wave,” Palermo explains. “We used fetch to approximate wave height because the bigger the fetch, the longer the distance over which wind can blow and waves can grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test how shoreline shapes would differ between the three scenarios, the researchers started with a simulated sea with flooded river valleys around its edges. For wave-driven erosion, they calculated the fetch distance from every single point along the shoreline to every other point, and converted these distances to wave heights. Then, they ran their simulation to see how waves would erode the starting shoreline over time. They compared this to how the same shoreline would evolve under erosion driven by uniform erosion. The team repeated this comparative modeling for hundreds of different starting shoreline shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the end shapes were very different depending on the underlying mechanism. Most notably, uniform erosion produced inflated shorelines that widened evenly all around, even in the flooded river valleys, whereas wave erosion mainly smoothed the parts of the shorelines exposed to long fetch distances, leaving the flooded valleys narrow and rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had the same starting shorelines, and we saw that you get a really different final shape under uniform erosion versus wave erosion,” Perron says. “They all kind of look like the Flying Spaghetti Monster because of the flooded river valleys, but the two types of erosion produce very different endpoints.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team checked their results by comparing their simulations to actual lakes on Earth. They found the same difference in shape between Earth lakes known to have been eroded by waves and lakes affected by uniform erosion, such as dissolving limestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A shore’s shape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their modeling revealed clear, characteristic shoreline shapes, depending on the mechanism by which they evolved. The team then wondered: Where would Titan’s shorelines fit, within these characteristic shapes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they focused on four of Titan’s largest, most well-mapped seas: Kraken Mare, which is comparable in size to the Caspian Sea; Ligeia Mare, which is larger than Lake Superior; Punga Mare, which is longer than Lake Victoria; and Ontario Lacus, which is about 20 percent the size of its terrestrial namesake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team mapped the shorelines of each Titan sea using Cassini’s radar images, and then applied their modeling to each of the sea’s shorelines to see which erosion mechanism best explained their shape. They found that all four seas fit solidly in the wave-driven erosion model, meaning that waves produced shorelines that most closely resembled Titan’s four seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that if the coastlines have eroded, their shapes are more consistent with erosion by waves than by uniform erosion or no erosion at all,” Perron says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Felipe&amp;nbsp;Paniagua-Arroyave, associate professor in the School of Applied Sciences and Engineering at EAFIT University in Colombia, says the team’s results are “unlocking new avenues of understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Waves are ubiquitous on Earth’s oceans. If Titan has waves, they would likely dominate the surface of lakes,” says&amp;nbsp;Paniagua-Arroyave, who was not involved in the study. ”It would be fascinating to see how Titan’s winds create waves, not of water, but of exotic liquid hydrocarbons.”The researchers are working to determine how strong Titan’s winds must be in order to stir up waves that could repeatedly chip away at the coasts. They also hope to decipher, from the shape of Titan’s shorelines, from which directions the wind is predominantly blowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Titan presents this case of a completely untouched system,” Palermo says. “It could help us learn more fundamental things about how coasts erode without the influence of people, and maybe that can help us better manage our coastlines on Earth in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by NASA, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Heising-Simons Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/sarah-millholland/"&gt;Sarah Millholland&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of physics at MIT and member of the&amp;nbsp;Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research,&amp;nbsp;is the 2024 recipient of the Vera Rubin Early Career Award for her wide-ranging contributions to the formation and dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The American Astronomical Society’s Division on Dynamical Astronomy (DDA) recognized Millholland for her demonstration “that super-Earth planets within a planetary system typically have similar masses, that the&amp;nbsp;statistics of compact multi-planet systems are consistent with a smooth inclination distribution, and that&amp;nbsp;resonances trapping&amp;nbsp;obliquities to high values may enhance the&amp;nbsp;tidal evolution of planetary orbits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citation noted that her work “is distinguished by thoughtful analyses of 3D dynamical&amp;nbsp;processes in planetary systems and by effective use of observational data to constrain dynamical models.”&amp;nbsp;Millholland is invited to give a lecture at the 56th annual DDA meeting in spring 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am incredibly honored to receive the&amp;nbsp;DDA Vera Rubin Early Career Prize, and I am especially grateful to my advisors and mentors within the dynamical astronomy community,” says Millholland. “The DDA means a lot to me, and I look forward to continuing to be a part of it for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millholland is a data-driven dynamicist who studies extrasolar planets, including their formation and evolution, orbital architectures, and interiors/atmospheres.&amp;nbsp;She studies patterns in the observed planetary&amp;nbsp;orbital architectures, referring to properties like the spacings, eccentricities, inclinations, axial tilts, and planetary size relationships. She specializes in investigating how gravitational interactions like&amp;nbsp;tides, resonances, and spin dynamics&amp;nbsp;sculpt observable exoplanet properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millholland obtained bachelor’s degrees in physics and applied mathematics from the University of Saint Thomas in 2015. She earned her PhD in astronomy from Yale University in 2020, and was a NASA Sagan Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University until 2022, when she joined MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vera Rubin Early Career Prize was established in 2016 in honor of the late Vera Rubin, a longtime DDA Member and galactic dynamicist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sun’s surface is a brilliant display of sunspots and flares driven by the solar magnetic field, which is internally generated through a process called dynamo action. Astrophysicists have assumed that the sun’s field is generated deep within the star. But an MIT study finds that the sun’s activity may be shaped by a much shallower process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07315-1" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at MIT, the University of Edinburgh, and elsewhere find that the sun’s magnetic field could arise from instabilities within the sun’s outermost layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team generated a precise model of the sun’s surface and found that when they simulated certain perturbations, or changes in the flow of plasma (ionized gas) within the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun, these surface changes were enough to generate realistic magnetic field patterns, with similar characteristics to what astronomers have observed on the sun. In contrast, their simulations in deeper layers produced less realistic solar activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that sunspots and flares could be a product of a shallow magnetic field, rather than a field that originates deeper in the sun, as scientists had largely assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The features we see when looking at the sun, like the corona that many people saw during the recent solar eclipse, sunspots, and solar flares, are all associated with the sun’s magnetic field,” says study author Keaton Burns, a research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mathematics. “We show that isolated perturbations near the sun’s surface, far from the deeper layers, can grow over time to potentially produce the magnetic structures we see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the sun’s magnetic field does in fact arise from its outermost layers, this might give scientists a better chance at forecasting flares and geomagnetic storms that have the potential to damage satellites and telecommunications systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know the dynamo acts like a giant clock with many complex interacting parts,” says co-author Geoffrey Vasil, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “But we don't know many of the pieces or how they fit together. This new idea of how the solar dynamo starts is essential to understanding and predicting it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors also include Daniel Lecoanet and Kyle Augustson of Northwestern University, Jeffrey Oishi of Bates College, Benjamin Brown and Keith Julien of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Nicholas Brummell of the University of California at Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flow zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sun is a white-hot ball of plasma that’s boiling on its surface. This boiling region is called the “convection zone,” where layers and plumes of plasma roil and flow. The convection zone comprises the top one-third of the sun’s radius and stretches about 200,000 kilometers below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the basic ideas for how to start a dynamo is that you need a region where there’s a lot of plasma moving past other plasma, and that shearing motion converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy,” Burns explains. “People had thought that the sun’s magnetic field is created by the motions at the very bottom of the convection zone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pin down exactly where the sun’s magnetic field originates, other scientists have used large three-dimensional simulations to try to solve for the flow of plasma throughout the many layers of the sun’s interior. “Those simulations require millions of hours on national supercomputing facilities, but what they produce is still nowhere near as turbulent as the actual sun,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than simulating the complex flow of plasma throughout the entire body of the sun, Burns and his colleagues wondered whether studying the stability of plasma flow near the surface might be enough to explain the origins of the dynamo process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this idea, the team first used data from the field of “helioseismology,” where scientists use observed vibrations on the sun’s surface to determine the average structure and flow of plasma beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take a video of a drum and watch how it vibrates in slow motion, you can work out the drumhead’s shape and stiffness from the vibrational modes,” Burns says. “Similarly, we can use vibrations that we see on the solar surface to infer the average structure on the inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar onion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new study, the researchers collected models of the sun’s structure from helioseismic observations.&amp;nbsp;“These average flows look sort like an onion, with different layers of plasma rotating past each other,” Burns explains. “Then we ask: Are there perturbations, or tiny changes in the flow of plasma, that we could superimpose on top of this average structure, that might grow to cause the sun’s magnetic field?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look for such patterns, the team utilized the Dedalus Project — a numerical framework that Burns developed that can simulate many types of fluid flows with high precision. The code has been applied to a wide range of problems, from modeling the dynamics inside individual cells, to ocean and atmospheric circulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My collaborators have been thinking about the solar magnetism problem for years, and the capabilities of Dedalus have now reached the point where we could address it,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed algorithms that they incorporated into Dedalus to find self-reinforcing changes in the sun’s average surface flows. The algorithm discovered new patterns that could grow and result in realistic solar activity. In particular, the team found patterns that match the locations and timescales of sunspots that have been have observed by astronomers since Galileo in 1612.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunspots are transient features on the surface of the sun that are thought to be shaped by the sun’s magnetic field. These relatively cooler regions appear as dark spots in relation to the rest of the sun’s white-hot surface. Astronomers have long observed that sunspots occur in a cyclical pattern, growing and receding every 11 years, and generally gravitating around the equator, rather than near the poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the team’s simulations, they found that certain changes in the flow of plasma, within just the top 5 to 10 percent of the sun’s surface layers, were enough to generate magnetic structures in the same regions. In contrast, changes in deeper layers produce less realistic solar fields that are concentrated near the poles, rather than near the equator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was motivated to take a closer look at flow patterns near the surface as conditions there resembled the unstable plasma flows in entirely different systems: the accretion disks around black holes. Accretion disks are massive disks of gas and stellar dust that rotate in towards a black hole, driven by the “magnetorotational instability,” which generates turbulence in the flow and causes it to fall inward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burns and his colleagues suspected that a similar phenomena is at play in the sun, and that the magnetorotational instability in the sun’s outermost layers could be the first step in generating the sun’s magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this result may be controversial,” he ventures. “Most of the community has been focused on finding dynamo action deep in the sun. Now we’re showing there’s a different mechanism that seems to be a better match to observations.” Burns says that the team is continuing to study if the new surface field patterns can generate individual sunspots and the full 11-year solar cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is far from the final word on the problem,” says Steven Balbus, a professor of astronomy at Oxford University, who was not involved with the study. “However, it is a fresh and very promising avenue for further study. The current findings are very suggestive and the approach is innovative, and not in line with the current received wisdom. When the received wisdom has not been very fruitful for an extended period, something more creative is indicated, and that is what this work offers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by&amp;nbsp;NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronomers at MIT, NASA, and elsewhere have a new way to measure how fast a black hole spins, by using the wobbly aftermath from its stellar feasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method takes advantage of a black hole&amp;nbsp;tidal disruption event — a blazingly bright moment when a black hole&amp;nbsp;exerts tides on a&amp;nbsp;passing star&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;rips it to shreds. As the star is disrupted by the black hole’s immense tidal forces, half of the star is blown away, while the other half is flung around the black hole, generating an intensely hot accretion disk of rotating stellar material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT-led team has shown that the wobble of the newly created accretion disk is key to working out the central black hole’s inherent spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07433-w" target="_blank"&gt;study appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the astronomers report that they have&amp;nbsp;measured the spin of a nearby supermassive black hole by tracking the pattern of X-ray flashes that the black hole produced immediately following a tidal disruption event. The team followed the flashes over several months and determined that they were likely a signal of a bright-hot accretion disk that wobbled back and forth as it was pushed and pulled by the black hole’s own spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking how the disk’s wobble changed over time, the scientists could work out how much the disk was being affected by the black hole’s spin, and in turn, how fast the black hole itself was spinning. Their analysis showed that the black hole was spinning at&amp;nbsp;less than 25 percent the speed of light — relatively slow, as black holes go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, MIT Research Scientist Dheeraj “DJ” Pasham, says the new method could be used to gauge the spins of hundreds of black holes in the local universe in the coming years. If scientists can survey the spins of many nearby black holes, they can start to understand how the gravitational giants evolved over the history of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By studying several systems in the coming years with this method, astronomers can estimate the overall distribution of black hole spins and understand the longstanding question of how they evolve over time,” says Pasham, who is a member of MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-authors include collaborators from a number of institutions, including NASA, Masaryk University in the Czech Republic, the University of Leeds, the University of Syracuse, Tel Aviv University, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shredded heat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every black hole has an inherent spin that has been shaped by its cosmic encounters over time. If, for instance, a black hole has grown mostly through accretion — brief instances when some material falls onto the disk, this causes the black hole to spin up to quite high speeds. In contrast, if a black hole grows mostly by merging with other black holes, each merger could slow things down as one black hole’s spin meets up against the spin of the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a black hole spins, it drags the surrounding space-time around with it. This drag effect is an example of Lense-Thirring precession, a longstanding theory that describes the ways in which extremely strong gravitational fields, such as those generated by a black hole, can pull on the surrounding space and time. Normally, this effect would not be obvious around black holes, as the massive objects emit no light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in recent years, physicists have proposed that, in instances&amp;nbsp;such as during a tidal disruption event, or TDE, scientists might have a chance to track the light&amp;nbsp;from stellar debris as&amp;nbsp;it is&amp;nbsp;dragged around. Then, they might hope to measure the black hole’s spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, during a TDE, scientists predict that a star may fall onto a black hole from any direction, generating a disk of white-hot, shredded material that could be tilted, or misaligned, with respect to the black hole’s spin. (Imagine the accretion disk as a tilted donut that is spinning around a donut hole that has its own, separate spin.) As the disk encounters the black hole’s spin, it wobbles as the black hole pulls it into alignment. Eventually, the wobbling subsides as the disk settles into the black hole’s spin. Scientists predicted that a TDE’s wobbling disk should therefore be a measurable signature of the black hole’s spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the key was to have the right observations,” Pasham says. “The only way you can do this is, as soon as a tidal disruption event goes off, you need to get a telescope to look at this object continuously, for a very long time, so you can probe all kinds of timescales, from minutes to months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A high-cadence catch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Pasham has looked for tidal disruption events that are bright enough, and near enough, to quickly follow up and track for signs of Lense-Thirring precession. In February of 2020, he and his colleagues got lucky, with the detection of AT2020ocn, a bright flash, emanating from a galaxy about&amp;nbsp;a billion light years away, that was initially spotted in the optical band by the Zwicky Transient Facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the optical data, the flash appeared to be the first moments following a TDE. Being both bright and relatively close by, Pasham suspected the TDE might be the ideal candidate to look for signs of disk wobbling, and possibly measure the spin of the black hole at the&amp;nbsp;host &amp;nbsp;galaxy’s center. But for that, he would need much more data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We needed quick and high-cadence data,” Pasham says. “The key was to catch this early on because this precession, or wobble, should only be present early on. Any later, and the disk would not wobble anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that NASA’s NICER telescope was able to catch the TDE and continuously keep an eye on it over months at a time. NICER — an abbreviation for Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR — is an X-ray telescope on the International Space Station that measures X-ray radiation around black holes and other extreme gravitational objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasham and his colleagues looked through NICER’s observations of AT2020ocn over 200 days following the initial detection of the tidal disruption event. They discovered that the event emitted X-rays that appeared to peak every 15 days, for several cycles, before eventually petering out. They interpreted the peaks as times when the TDE’s accretion disk wobbled face-on, emitting X-rays directly toward NICER’s telescope, before wobbling away as it continued to emit X-rays (similar to waving a flashlight toward and away from someone every 15&amp;nbsp;days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took this pattern of wobbling and worked it into the original theory for Lense-Thirring precession. Based on estimates of the black hole’s mass, and that of the disrupted star, they were able to come up with an estimate for the black hole’s spin —&amp;nbsp;less than 25 percent the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results mark the first time that scientists have used observations of a&amp;nbsp;wobbling disk following a&amp;nbsp;tidal disruption event to estimate the spin of a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Black holes are fascinating objects and the flows of material that we see falling onto them can generate some of the most luminous events in the universe,” says study co-author Chris Nixon, associate professor of theoretical physics at the University of Leeds. “While there is a lot we still don’t understand, there are amazing observational facilities that keep surprising us and generating new avenues to explore. This event is one of those surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory come online in the coming years, Pasham foresees more opportunities to pin down black hole spins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The spin of a supermassive black hole tells you about the history of that black hole,” Pasham says. “Even if a small fraction of those that Rubin captures have this kind of signal, we now have a way to measure the spins of hundreds of TDEs. Then we could make a big statement about how black holes evolve over the age of the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by NASA and the European Space Agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new CubeSat orbiting Earth represents a multinational academic-industry collaboration and an important milestone in Portugal’s space program, marking the country’s return to space after its first satellite launch 30 years ago. The small satellite, called AEROS-MH1, was developed entirely in Portugal through a four-year collaboration between the MIT Portugal Program and researchers at several Portuguese universities and private companies. MIT’s participation in the project, known as AEROS Constellation, was financially supported by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Professors Dava Newman, Kerri Cahoy, and Richard Linares served as co-principal investigators on the project at MIT, and grad students Madeline Anderson, Cadence Payne, and Annika Thomas served as key contributors along with researchers from University of Minho, CEiiA, Edisoft, and more. AEROS Constellation’s objectives support Portugal’s multinational “Atlantic interactions” research efforts and are aligned with the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Launched in March, AEROS-MH1 is now orbiting Earth every 90 minutes at an altitude of almost 137 miles. AEROS will apply spectroscopic techniques to measure and monitor ocean health while using a software-defined radio to bridge connectivity between the spacecraft, aerial drones, and bio-logged marine life such as sharks and rays. The satellite will collect hyperspectral imaging data of the coastline and oceans around Portugal, and collect information from the software-defined radio from tags to help understand biodiversity and the environment around Portugal. The satellite’s command center is at the Santa Maria Island Teleport in the Azores, where the spectroscopic imagery will be recorded, and then processed in Matosinhos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“AEROS was a tremendously valuable experience for our students, both in terms of the research and technical elements and the collaboration itself,” says Cahoy. “The full team had weekly meetings virtually, and it did get interesting when there were changes in the time zones for daylight savings that were different in each country, along with understanding holidays and special event times of the year, as well as when the academic team members would have a higher workload due to projects and exams. The students really enjoyed that MIT Portugal regularly provided opportunities to get together and present their work in Portugal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The project’s development process began in 2020 with the mission concept, focused on maritime priorities and ocean characterization around Portugal. The research team selected instruments like the hyperspectral visible imager to characterize the ocean’s colors, and software-defined radio to flexibly support collecting data from small transmitters on the Earth for sensing environment and monitoring biodiversity. The team worked for years to make sure these instruments were fully functional in hardware and software, as well as with a spacecraft platform that supported the mission power and communication needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MIT students supported the project with analyses and simulations to help understand if the mission would meet requirements. Annika Thomas focused on thermal management; Cadence Payne focused on the hyperspectral imager instrument performance; and Madi Anderson worked on using AI for both change detection in the instrument data and to help identify any anomalies in the onboard telemetry. Other MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics students who supported AEROS include Miles Lifson, Patrick McKeen, Joey Murphy, and Alvin Harvey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The partnership between the Portuguese institutions and our international universities such as MIT must be maintained. It results in high-quality training, new jobs, and a new generation of students who are multidisciplinary systems leaders of our space future and our future here on Earth,” said Newman in a congratulatory video. “We’re educating these future leaders in important sectors such as climate, space, oceans, urban mobility, and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronomers at MIT, the University of Liège, and elsewhere have discovered a new planet orbiting a small cold star, a mere 55 light years away. The nearby planet is similar to Earth in its size and rocky composition, though that’s where the similarities end. Because this new world is likely missing an atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02271-2" target="_blank"&gt;paper appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers confirm the detection of SPECULOOS-3b, an Earth-sized, likely airless planet that the team discovered using a network of telescopes as part of the SPECULOOS (Search for Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet orbits a nearby ultracool dwarf — a type of star that is smaller and colder than the sun. Ultracool dwarf stars are thought to be the most common type of star in our galaxy, though they are also the faintest, making them difficult to spot in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultracool dwarf that hosts the new planet is about one-tenth the size of, and 1,000 times dimmer than, the sun. The star is more similar in size to Jupiter and is twice as cold as the sun. Nevertheless, the dwarf star radiates an enormous amount of energy onto the planet’s surface due to the planet’s extremely close proximity: SPECULOOS-3b circles its star in just 17 hours. One year on the new planet, then, is shorter than one day on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is so close to its star, the planet is blasted with 16 times more radiation per second compared to what the Earth receives from the sun. The team believes that such intense and relentless exposure has likely vaporized any atmosphere that the planet once held, leaving it an airless, exposed, blistering ball of rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the planet lacks an atmosphere, scientists might soon be able to zero in on exactly what type of rocks are on its surface and even what sort of geological processes shaped its landscape,&amp;nbsp;such as whether the planet’s crust experienced magma oceans, volcanic activity, and plate tectonics in its past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SPECULOOS-3b is the first planet for which we can consider moving toward constraining surface properties of planets beyond the solar system,”&amp;nbsp;says study co-author Julien de Wit, associate&amp;nbsp;professor of planetary sciences at MIT. “With this world, we could basically start doing exoplanetary geology. How cool is that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include research scientists Benjamin Rackham and Artem Burdanov, along with lead author Michel Gillon of the University of Liège and colleagues from collaborating institutions and observatories around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lining up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers observed the first inklings of the new planet in 2021, with observations taken by SPECULOOS — a network of six robotic, 1-meter telescopes (four in the Southern Hemisphere, and two in the Northern Hemisphere) that continuously observe the sky for signs of planets orbiting around ultracool dwarf stars. SPECULOOS is the parent project of the TRAPPIST (TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope-South) survey, which discovered seven terrestrial planets — several potentially habitable — around a small cold star named TRAPPIST-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPECULOOS aims to observe about 1,600 nearby ultracool dwarf stars. As these stars are small, any planets that orbit and cross in front of them should momentarily block their light, by a more noticeable amount compared to planets that orbit around larger, brighter stars. Ultracool dwarf stars, then, could give astronomers a better view of any planets that they host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a telescope in SPECULOOS’ network picked up some inconclusive signs of a transit, in front of one ultracool dwarf star about 55 light years away. Then in 2022, a close monitoring with MIT’s Artemis telescope changed the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there were structures in the 2021 data that didn’t look convincing, the 2022 Artemis data really got our attention,” recalls MIT’s Artem Burdanov, who manages the SPECULOOS Northern Observatory. “We started to analyze one clear transit-like signal in the Artemis data, quickly decided to launch a campaign around this star, and then things just started lining up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="_com_1" language="JavaScript" onmouseover="msoCommentShow(&amp;apos;_anchor_1&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;_com_1&amp;apos;)" onmouseout="msoCommentHide(&amp;apos;_com_1&amp;apos;)"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark like the moon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team zeroed in on the star with MIT’s Artemis telescope, the rest of the SPECULOOS network, and several other observatories. The multipronged observations confirmed that the star did indeed host a planet, which appeared to orbit every 17 hours. Judging from the amount of light it blocked with each crossing, the scientists estimate that the planet is about the size of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were then able to estimate certain properties of the star and the planet based on analyses of the star’s light taken by MIT’s Benjamin Rackham, who has led a campaign using the Magellan telescopes in Chile and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Hawaii to analyze the light from nearby ultracool dwarf stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can say from our spectra and other observations that the star has a temperature of about 2,800 kelvins, it is about 7 billion years old — not too young, and not too old — and it is moderately active, meaning that it flares quite a lot,” Rackham says. “We think the planet must not have an atmosphere anymore because it would easily have been eroded away by the activity of the host star that’s basically constantly flaring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without an atmosphere, then, what might one see if they were to look up from the planet’s surface?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s no atmosphere, there would be no blue sky or clouds — it would just be dark, like on the surface of the moon,” Rackham offers. “And the ‘sun’ would be a big, purplish-red, spotted, and flaring star that would look about 18 times as big as the sun looks to us in the sky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the planet lacks an atmosphere and is relatively close by, the team says that SPECULOOS-3b is an ideal candidate for follow-up studies by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which is powerful enough to parse the star’s light and discern more details of both the star and the planet. With JWST’s observations, the team hopes to be able to identify details of the planet’s surface, which would be a first in the field of exoplanetary studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that the planet is nearly as hot as Venus, so not habitable,” Rackham says. “It’s not hot enough to have a lava surface. It should be solid rock. But depending on how bright that rock is, it could be recently resurfaced due to plate tectonics or volcanic activity, or it could be a planet that’s been eroded by space weathering and has a much darker surface. Going forward, we should be able to distinguish between some interesting scenarios for the surface of the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the European Research Council, the Simons Foundation, and the Heising-Simons Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Need a moment of levity? Try watching &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/watch-apollo-astronauts-falling-moon-1449937" target="_blank"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; of astronauts falling on the moon. NASA’s outtakes of Apollo astronauts tripping and stumbling as they bounce in slow motion are delightfully relatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For MIT engineers, the lunar bloopers also highlight an opportunity to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Astronauts are physically very capable, but they can struggle on the moon, where gravity is one-sixth that of Earth’s but their inertia is still the same. Furthermore, wearing a spacesuit is a significant burden and can constrict their movements,” says Harry Asada, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “We want to provide a safe way for astronauts to get back on their feet if they fall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asada and his colleagues are designing a pair of wearable robotic limbs that can physically support an astronaut and lift them back on their feet after a fall. The system, which the researchers have dubbed Supernumerary Robotic Limbs or “SuperLimbs” is designed to extend from a backpack, which would also carry the astronaut’s life support system, along with the controller and motors to power the limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have built a physical prototype, as well as a control system to direct the limbs, based on feedback from the astronaut using it. The team tested a preliminary version on healthy subjects who also volunteered to wear a constrictive garment similar to an astronaut’s spacesuit. When the volunteers attempted to get up from a sitting or lying position, they did so with less effort when assisted by SuperLimbs, compared to when they had to recover on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team envisions that SuperLimbs can physically assist astronauts after a fall and, in the process, help them conserve their energy for other essential tasks. The design could prove especially useful in the coming years, with the launch of NASA’s Artemis mission, which plans to send astronauts back to the moon for the first time in over 50 years. Unlike the largely exploratory mission of Apollo, Artemis astronauts will endeavor to build the first permanent moon base — a physically demanding task that will require multiple extended extravehicular activities (EVAs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the Apollo era, when astronauts would fall, 80 percent of the time it was when they were doing excavation or some sort of job with a tool,” says team member and MIT doctoral student Erik Ballesteros. “The Artemis missions will really focus on construction and excavation, so the risk of falling is much higher. We think that SuperLimbs can help them recover so they can be more productive, and extend their EVAs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asada, Ballesteros, and their colleagues will present their design and study this week at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). Their co-authors include MIT postdoc&amp;nbsp;Sang-Yoep Lee and Kalind Carpenter of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking a stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s design is the latest application of SuperLimbs, which Asada first developed about a decade ago and has since adapted for a range of applications, including assisting workers in aircraft manufacturing, construction, and ship building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Asada and Ballesteros wondered whether SuperLimbs might assist astronauts, particularly as NASA plans to send astronauts back to the surface of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In communications with NASA, we learned that this issue of falling on the moon is a serious risk,” Asada says. “We realized that we could make some modifications to our design to help astronauts recover from falls and carry on with their work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team first took a step back, to study the ways in which humans naturally recover from a fall. In their new study, they asked several healthy volunteers to attempt to stand upright after lying on their side, front, and back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at how the volunteers’ attempts to stand changed when their movements were constricted, similar to the way astronauts’ movements are limited by the bulk of their spacesuits. The team built a suit to mimic the stiffness of traditional spacesuits, and had volunteers don the suit before again attempting to stand up from various fallen positions. The volunteers’ sequence of movements was similar, though required much more effort compared to their unencumbered attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team mapped the movements of each volunteer as they stood up, and found that they each carried out a common sequence of motions, moving from one pose, or “waypoint,” to the next, in a predictable order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those ergonomic experiments helped us to model in a straightforward way, how a human stands up,” Ballesteros says. “We could postulate that about 80 percent of humans stand up in a similar way. Then we designed a controller around that trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed software to generate a trajectory for a robot, following a sequence that would help support a human and lift them back on their feet. They applied the controller to a heavy, fixed robotic arm, which they attached to a large backpack. The researchers then attached the backpack to the bulky suit and helped volunteers back into the suit. They asked the volunteers to again lie on their back, front, or side, and then had them attempt to stand as the robot sensed the person’s movements and adapted to help them to their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the volunteers were able to stand stably with much less effort when assisted by the robot, compared to when they tried to stand alone while wearing the bulky suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels kind of like an extra force moving with you,” says Ballesteros, who also tried out the suit and arm assist. “Imagine wearing a backpack and someone grabs the top and sort of pulls you up. Over time, it becomes sort of natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments confirmed that the control system can successfully direct a robot to help a person stand back up after a fall. The researchers plan to pair the control system with their latest version of SuperLimbs, which comprises two multijointed robotic arms that can extend out from a backpack. The backpack would also contain the robot’s battery and motors, along with an astronaut’s ventilation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We designed these robotic arms based on an AI search and design optimization, to look for designs of classic robot manipulators with certain engineering constraints,” Ballesteros says. “We filtered through many designs and looked for the design that consumes the least amount of energy to lift a person up. This version of SuperLimbs is the product of that process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, Ballesteros will build out the full SuperLimbs system at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he plans to streamline the design and minimize the weight of its parts and motors using advanced, lightweight materials. Then, he hopes to pair the limbs with astronaut suits, and test them in low-gravity simulators, with the goal of someday assisting astronauts on future missions to the moon and Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wearing a spacesuit can be a physical burden,” Asada notes. “Robotic systems can help ease that burden, and help astronauts be more productive during their missions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astronomers at MIT, the University of Liège in Belgium, and elsewhere have discovered a huge, fluffy oddball of a planet orbiting a distant star in our Milky Way galaxy. The discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-024-02259-y" target="_blank"&gt;reported today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Astronomy&lt;/em&gt;, is a promising key to the mystery of how such giant, super-light planets form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet, named WASP-193b, appears to dwarf Jupiter in size, yet it is a fraction of its density. The scientists found that the gas giant is 50 percent bigger than Jupiter, and about a tenth as dense — an extremely low density, comparable to that of cotton candy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASP-193b is the second lightest planet discovered to date, after the smaller, Neptune-like world, Kepler 51d. The new planet’s much larger size, combined with its super-light density, make WASP-193b something of an oddity among the more than 5,400 planets discovered to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To find these giant objects with such a small density is really, really rare,” says lead study author and MIT postdoc&amp;nbsp;Khalid Barkaoui. “There’s a class of planets called puffy Jupiters, and it’s been a mystery for 15 years now as to what they are. And this is an extreme case of that class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know where to put this planet in all the formation theories we have right now, because it’s an outlier of all of them,” adds co-lead author Francisco Pozuelos, a senior researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalucia, in Spain. “We cannot explain how this planet was formed, based on classical evolution models. Looking more closely at its atmosphere will allow us to obtain an evolutionary path of this planet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include Julien de Wit, an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, and MIT postdoc&amp;nbsp;Artem Burdanov, along with collaborators from multiple institutions across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“An interesting twist”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new planet was initially spotted by the Wide Angle Search for Planets, or WASP — an international collaboration of academic institutions that together operate two robotic observatories, one in the northern hemisphere and the other in the south. Each observatory uses an array of wide-angle cameras to measure the brightness of thousands of individual stars across the entire sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In surveys taken between 2006 and 2008, and again from 2011 to 2012, the WASP-South observatory detected periodic transits, or dips in light, from WASP-193 — a bright, nearby, sun-like star located 1,232 light years from Earth. Astronomers determined that the star’s periodic dips in brightness were consistent with a planet circling the star and blocking its light every 6.25 days. The scientists measured the total amount of light the planet blocked with each transit, which gave them an estimate of the planet’s giant, super-Jupiter size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The astronomers then looked to pin down the planet’s mass — a measure that would then reveal its density and potentially also clues to its composition. To get a mass estimate, astronomers typically employ radial velocity, a technique in which scientists analyze a star’s spectrum, or various wavelengths of light, as a planet circles the star. A star’s spectrum can be shifted in specific ways depending on whatever is pulling on the star, such as an orbiting planet. The more massive a planet is, and the closer it is to its star, the more its spectrum can shift — a distortion that can give scientists an idea of a planet’s mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For WASP-193 b, astronomers obtained additional high-resolution spectra of the star taken by various ground-based telescopes, and attempted to employ radial velocity to calculate the planet’s mass. But they kept coming up empty — precisely because, as it turned out, the planet was far too light to have any detectable pull on its star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, big planets are pretty easy to detect because they are usually massive, and lead to a big pull on their star,” de Wit explains. “But what was tricky about this planet was, even though it’s big — huge — its mass and density are so low that it was actually very difficult to detect with just the radial velocity technique. It was an interesting twist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[WASP-193b] is so very light that it took four years to gather data and show that there is a mass signal, but it’s really, really tiny,”&amp;nbsp;Barkaoui says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were initially getting extremely low densities, which were very difficult to believe in the beginning,” Pozuelos adds. “We repeated the process of all the data analysis several times to make sure this was the real density of the planet because this was super rare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An inflated world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the team confirmed that the planet was indeed extremely light. Its mass, they calculated, was about 0.14 that of Jupiter. And its density, derived from its mass, came out to about 0.059 grams per cubic centimeter. Jupiter, in contrast, is about 1.33 grams per cubic centimeter; and Earth is a more substantial 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter. Perhaps the material closest in density to the new, puffy planet is cotton candy, which has a density of about 0.05 grams per cubic centimeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The planet is so light that it’s difficult to think of an analogous, solid-state material,” Barkaoui says. “The reason why it’s close to cotton candy is because both are mostly made of light gases rather than solids. The planet is basically super fluffy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that the new planet is made mostly from hydrogen and helium, like most other gas giants in the galaxy. For WASP-193b, these gases likely form a hugely inflated atmosphere that extends tens of thousands of kilometers farther than Jupiter’s own atmosphere. Exactly how a planet can inflate so far while maintaining a super-light density is a question that no existing theory of planetary formation can yet answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a better picture of the new fluffy world, the team plans to use &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/new-technique-measures-mass-of-exoplanets-1219" target="_blank"&gt;a technique&amp;nbsp;de Wit previously developed&lt;/a&gt;, to first derive certain properties of&amp;nbsp;the planet’s&amp;nbsp;atmosphere, such as its temperature, composition, and pressure at various depths. These characteristics can then be used to&amp;nbsp;precisely&amp;nbsp;work out the planet’s mass.&amp;nbsp;For now, the team sees WASP-193b as an ideal candidate for follow-up study by observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bigger a planet’s atmosphere, the more light can go through,” de Wit says. “So it’s clear that this planet is one of the best targets we have for studying atmospheric effects. It will be a Rosetta Stone to try and resolve the mystery of puffy Jupiters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by&amp;nbsp;consortium universities&amp;nbsp;and the UK’s Science and Technology Facilities Council for WASP; the&amp;nbsp;European Research Council; the&amp;nbsp;Wallonia-Brussels Federation;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Heising-Simons Foundation, Colin&amp;nbsp;and Leslie&amp;nbsp;Masson, and&amp;nbsp;Peter A. Gilman,&amp;nbsp;supporting Artemis and the other SPECULOOS Telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers, including several undergraduate students, have discovered three of the oldest stars in the universe, and they happen to live in our own galactic neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team spotted the stars in the Milky Way’s “halo” — the cloud of stars that&amp;nbsp;envelopes the entire&amp;nbsp;main galactic disk. Based on the team’s analysis, the three stars formed between 12 and 13 billion years ago, the time when the very first galaxies were taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have coined the stars “SASS,” for Small Accreted Stellar System stars, as they believe each star once belonged to its own small, primitive galaxy that was later absorbed by&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;larger&amp;nbsp;but still growing&amp;nbsp;Milky Way. Today, the three stars are all that are left of their respective galaxies. They circle the outskirts of the Milky Way, where the team suspects there may be more such ancient stellar survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These oldest stars should definitely be there, given what we know of galaxy formation,” says MIT professor of physics Anna Frebel. “They are part of our cosmic family tree. And we now have a new way to find them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they uncover similar SASS stars, the researchers hope to use them as analogs of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, which are thought to be some of the universe’s&amp;nbsp;surviving&amp;nbsp;first galaxies. Such galaxies are still intact today but are too distant and faint for astronomers to study in depth. As SASS stars may have once belonged to similarly primitive dwarf galaxies but are&amp;nbsp;in the Milky Way and as such&amp;nbsp;much closer, they could be an accessible key to understanding the evolution of ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we can look for more analogs in the Milky Way, that are much brighter, and study their chemical evolution without having to chase these extremely faint stars,” Frebel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae670" target="_blank"&gt;published their findings today&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS)&lt;/em&gt;. The study’s co-authors are Mohammad Mardini, at&amp;nbsp;Zarqa University, in Jordan; Hillary Andales ’23; and current MIT undergraduates Ananda Santos and Casey Fienberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stellar frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s discoveries grew out of a classroom&amp;nbsp;concept. During the 2022 fall semester, Frebel launched a new course, 8.S30&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(Observational Stellar Archaeology), in which students learned techniques for analyzing ancient stars and then applied those tools to stars that had never been studied before, to determine their origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most of our classes are taught from the ground up, this class immediately put us at the frontier of research in astrophysics,” Andales says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students worked from star data collected by Frebel over the years from&amp;nbsp;the 6.5-meter Magellan-Clay telescope&amp;nbsp;at the Las Campanas Observatory. She keeps hard copies of the data in a large binder in her office, which the students combed through to look for stars of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, they were searching ancient stars that formed&amp;nbsp;soon after the Big Bang, which occurred&amp;nbsp;13.8 billion years ago. At this time, the universe was made mostly of hydrogen and helium and very low abundances of other chemical elements, such as strontium and barium. So, the students looked through Frebel’s binder for stars with spectra, or measurements of starlight, that indicated low abundances of strontium and barium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their search narrowed in on three stars that were originally observed by the Magellan&amp;nbsp;telescope&amp;nbsp;between 2013 and 2014. Astronomers never followed up on these particular stars to interpret their spectra and deduce their origins. They were, then, perfect candidates for the students in Frebel’s class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students&amp;nbsp;learned how to characterize a star in order to prepare for the analysis of&amp;nbsp;the spectra for each of the three stars. They&amp;nbsp;were able to determine the chemical composition of each one with&amp;nbsp;various&amp;nbsp;stellar&amp;nbsp;models.&amp;nbsp;The intensity of a particular&amp;nbsp;feature in the stellar spectrum, corresponding to a specific&amp;nbsp;wavelength of light, corresponds to a particular abundance of a specific element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After&amp;nbsp;finalizing their analysis, the students were able to confidently conclude that the three stars did hold very low abundances of strontium, barium, and other&amp;nbsp;elements such as iron, compared to their&amp;nbsp;reference&amp;nbsp;star — our own sun. In fact, one star contained less than 1/10,000 the amount of iron to helium compared to the sun today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took a lot of hours staring at a computer, and a lot of debugging, frantically texting and emailing each other to figure this out,” Santos recalls. “It was a big learning curve, and a special experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“On the run”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stars’ low chemical abundance did hint that they originally formed 12 to 13 billion years ago. In fact, their low chemical signatures were similar to what astronomers had previously measured for some ancient, ultrafaint dwarf galaxies. Did the team’s stars originate in similar galaxies? And how did they come to be in the Milky Way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a hunch, the scientists checked out the stars’ orbital patterns and how they move across the sky. The three stars are in different locations throughout the Milky Way’s halo and are estimated to be about 30,000 light years from Earth. (For reference, the disk of the Milky Way spans 100,000 light years across.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they retraced each star’s motion&amp;nbsp;about the galactic center using observations from the Gaia astrometric satellite, the team noticed a curious thing: Relative to most of the stars in the main disk, which move like cars on a racetrack, all three stars seemed to be going the wrong way. In astronomy, this is known as “retrograde motion” and is a tipoff that an object was once “accreted,” or drawn in from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only way you can have stars going the wrong way from the rest of the gang is if you threw them in the wrong way,” Frebel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these three stars were orbiting in completely different ways from the rest of the galactic disk and even the halo, combined with the fact that they held low chemical abundances, made a strong case that the stars were indeed ancient and once belonged to older, smaller dwarf galaxies that fell into the Milky Way at random angles and continued their stubborn trajectories billions of years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frebel, curious as to whether retrograde motion was a feature of other ancient stars in the halo that astronomers previously analyzed, looked through the scientific literature and found 65 other stars, also with low strontium and barium abundances, that appeared to also be going against the galactic flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly they’re all quite fast — hundreds of kilometers per second, going the wrong way,” Frebel says. “They’re on the run! We don’t know why that’s the case, but&amp;nbsp;it was the piece to the puzzle that we needed, and that I didn’t quite anticipate when we started.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is eager to search out other ancient SASS stars, and they now have a relatively simple recipe to do so: First, look for stars with low chemical abundances, and then track their orbital patterns for signs of retrograde motion. Of the more than 400 billion stars in the Milky Way, they anticipate that the method will turn up a small but significant number of the universe’s oldest stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frebel plans to relaunch the class&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;fall, and looks back at that first course, and the three students who took their results through to publication, with admiration and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been awesome to work with three women undergrads. That’s a first for me,” she says. “It’s really an example of the MIT way. We do. And whoever says, ‘I want to participate,’ they can do that, and good things happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT astronomers have observed the elusive starlight surrounding some of the earliest quasars in the universe. The distant signals, which trace back more than 13 billion years to the universe’s infancy, are revealing clues to how the very first black holes and galaxies evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quasars are the blazing centers of active galaxies, which host an insatiable supermassive black hole at their core. Most galaxies host a central black hole that may occasionally feast on gas and stellar debris, generating a brief burst of light in the form of a glowing ring as material swirls in toward the black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quasars, by contrast, can consume enormous amounts of matter over much longer stretches of time, generating an extremely bright and long-lasting ring — so bright, in fact, that quasars are among the most luminous objects in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are so bright, quasars outshine the rest of the galaxy in which they reside. But the MIT team was able for the first time to observe the much fainter light from stars in the host galaxies of three ancient quasars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this elusive stellar light, the researchers estimated the mass of each host galaxy, compared to the mass of its central supermassive black hole. They found that for these quasars, the central black holes were much more massive relative to their host galaxies, compared to their modern counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3914" target="_blank"&gt;published today in the &lt;em&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, may shed light on how the earliest supermassive black holes became so massive despite having a relatively short amount of cosmic time in which to grow. In particular, those earliest monster black holes may have sprouted from more massive “seeds” than more modern black holes did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the universe came into existence, there were seed black holes that then consumed material and grew in a very short time,” says study author Minghao Yue, a postdoc in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “One of the big questions is to understand how those monster black holes could grow so big, so fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These black holes are billions of times more massive than the sun, at a time when the universe is still in its infancy,” says study author Anna-Christina Eilers, assistant professor of physics at MIT. “Our results imply that in the early universe, supermassive black holes might have gained their mass before their host galaxies did, and the initial black hole seeds could have been more massive than today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eilers’ and Yue’s co-authors include MIT Kavli Director Robert Simcoe, MIT Hubble Fellow and postdoc Rohan Naidu, and collaborators in Switzerland, Austria, Japan, and at North Carolina State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dazzling cores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quasar’s extreme luminosity has been obvious since astronomers first discovered the objects in the 1960s. They assumed then that the quasar’s light stemmed from a single, star-like “point source.” Scientists designated the objects “quasars,” as a portmanteau of a “quasi-stellar” object. Since those first observations, scientists have realized that quasars are in fact not stellar in origin but emanate from the accretion of intensely powerful and persistent supermassive black holes sitting at the center of galaxies that also host stars, which are much fainter in comparison to their dazzling cores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been extremely challenging to separate the light from a quasar’s central black hole from the light of the host galaxy’s stars. The task is a bit like discerning a field of fireflies around a central, massive searchlight. But in recent years, astronomers have had a much better chance of doing so with the launch of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has been able to peer farther back in time, and with much higher sensitivity and resolution, than any existing observatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, Yue and Eilers used dedicated time on JWST to observe six known, ancient quasars, intermittently from the fall of 2022 through the following spring. In total, the team collected more than 120 hours of observations of the six distant objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The quasar outshines its host galaxy by orders of magnitude. And previous images were not sharp enough to distinguish what the host galaxy with all its stars looks like,” Yue says. “Now for the first time, we are able to reveal the light from these stars by very carefully modeling JWST’s much sharper images of those quasars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A light balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team took stock of the imaging data collected by JWST of each of the six distant quasars, which they estimated to be about 13 billion years old. That data included measurements of each quasar’s light in different wavelengths. The researchers fed that data into a model of how much of that light likely comes from a compact “point source,” such as a central black hole’s accretion disk, versus a more diffuse source, such as light from the host galaxy’s surrounding, scattered stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this modeling, the team teased apart each quasar’s light into two components: light from the central black hole’s luminous disk and light from the host galaxy’s more diffuse stars. The amount of light from both sources is a reflection of their total mass. The researchers estimate that for these quasars, the ratio between the mass of the central black hole and the mass of the host galaxy was about 1:10. This, they realized, was in stark contrast to today’s mass balance of 1:1,000, in which more recently formed black holes are much less massive compared to their host galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This tells us something about what grows first: Is it the black hole that grows first, and then the galaxy catches up? Or is the galaxy and its stars that first grow, and they dominate and regulate the black hole’s growth?” Eilers explains. “We see that black holes in the early universe seem to be growing faster than their host galaxies. That is tentative evidence that the initial black hole seeds could have been more massive back then.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There must have been some mechanism to make a black hole gain their mass earlier than their host galaxy in those first billion years,” Yue adds. “It’s kind of the first evidence we see for this, which is exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New research from the group of MIT Professor &lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/brett-mcguire/"&gt;Brett McGuire&lt;/a&gt; has revealed the presence of a previously unknown molecule in space. The team's open-access paper, “&lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad37ff" target="_blank"&gt;Rotational Spectrum and First Interstellar Detection of 2-Methoxyethanol Using ALMA Observations of NGC 6334I&lt;/a&gt;,” appears in April 12 issue of &lt;em&gt;The Astrophysical Journal Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/zachary-fried-wins-lewis-e-snyder-astrochemistry-award/" target="_blank"&gt;Zachary T.P. Fried&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/chemistry-news/graduate-student-spotlight-zachary-fried/" target="_blank"&gt;graduate student in the McGuire group&lt;/a&gt; and the lead author of the publication, worked to assemble a puzzle comprised of pieces collected from across the globe, extending beyond MIT to France, Florida, Virginia, and Copenhagen, to achieve this exciting discovery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our group tries to understand what molecules are present in regions of space where stars and solar systems will eventually take shape,” explains Fried. “This allows us to piece together how chemistry evolves alongside the process of star and planet formation. We do this by looking at the rotational spectra of molecules, the unique patterns of light they give off as they tumble end-over-end in space. These patterns are fingerprints (barcodes) for molecules. To detect new molecules in space, we first must have an idea of what molecule we want to look for, then we can record its spectrum in the lab here on Earth, and then finally we look for that spectrum in space using telescopes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for molecules in space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The McGuire Group has recently &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abe764/meta"&gt;begun to utilize machine learning&lt;/a&gt; to suggest good target molecules to search for. In 2023, one of these machine learning models suggested the researchers target a molecule known as 2-methoxyethanol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are a number of 'methoxy' molecules in space, like dimethyl ether, methoxymethanol, ethyl methyl ether, and methyl formate, but 2-methoxyethanol would be the largest and most complex ever seen,” says Fried. To detect this molecule using radiotelescope observations, the group first needed to measure and analyze its rotational spectrum on Earth. The researchers combined experiments from the University of Lille (Lille, France), the New College of Florida (Sarasota, Florida), and the McGuire lab at MIT to measure this spectrum over a broadband region of frequencies ranging from the microwave to sub-millimeter wave regimes (approximately 8 to 500 gigahertz).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data gleaned from these measurements permitted a search for the molecule using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations toward two separate star-forming regions: NGC 6334I and IRAS 16293-2422B. Members of the McGuire group analyzed these telescope observations alongside researchers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Charlottesville, Virginia) and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we observed 25 rotational lines of 2-methoxyethanol that lined up with the molecular signal observed toward NGC 6334I (the barcode matched!), thus resulting in a secure detection of 2-methoxyethanol in this source,” says Fried. “This allowed us to then derive physical parameters of the molecule toward NGC 6334I, such as its abundance and excitation temperature. It also enabled an investigation of the possible chemical formation pathways from known interstellar precursors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molecular discoveries like this one help the researchers to better understand the development of molecular complexity in space during the star formation process. 2-methoxyethanol, which contains 13 atoms, is quite large for interstellar standards&amp;nbsp;— as of 2021, &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac2a48/meta"&gt;only six species larger than 13 atoms were detected outside the solar system&lt;/a&gt;, many by McGuire’s group, and all of them existing as ringed structures.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Continued observations of large molecules and subsequent derivations of their abundances allows us to advance our knowledge of how efficiently large molecules can form and by which specific reactions they may be produced,” says Fried. “Additionally, since we detected this molecule in NGC 6334I but not in IRAS 16293-2422B, we were presented with a unique opportunity to look into how the differing physical conditions of these two sources may be affecting the chemistry that can occur.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Sandi Miller | Department of Physics</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Class of 1958 Career Development Assistant Professor Erin Kara of the Department of Physics has been named as the recipient of the 2023-24 Harold E. Edgerton Faculty Achievement Award.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Established in 1982, the award is a tribute to the late Institute Professor Emeritus Harold E. Edgerton for his support for younger faculty members. This award recognizes exceptional distinction in teaching, research, and service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Kara is an observational astrophysicist who is a faculty member in the Department of Physics and a member of the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research (MKI). She uses high-energy transients and time-variable phenomena to understand the physics behind how black holes grow and how they affect their environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kara has advanced a new technique called&amp;nbsp;X-ray reverberation mapping, which allows astronomers to map the gas falling onto black holes and measure the effects of strongly curved spacetime close to the event horizon. She also works on a variety of transient phenomena, such as tidal disruption events and galactic black hole outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is a NASA Participating Scientist for the XRISM Observatory, a joint JAXA/NASA X-ray spectroscopy&amp;nbsp;mission that just launched this past September, and is a NASA Participating Scientist for the ULTRASAT Mission, an ultraviolet all-sky time domain mission, set to launch in 2027. She is also working to develop and launch the next generation of NASA missions, as deputy principal investigator of the AXIS Probe Mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted for Erin,” says Claude Canizares, the Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics. “She is an exemplary Edgerton awardee. As one of the leading observational astrophysicists of her generation, she has made major advances in our understanding of black holes and their environments. She also plays a leadership role in the design of new space missions, is a passionate and effective teacher, and a thoughtful mentor of graduate students and postdocs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds Kavli Director Rob Simcoe, “Erin is one of a very rare breed of experimental astrophysicists who have the interest and stamina not only to use observatories built by colleagues before her, but also to dive into a leadership role planning and executing new spaceflight missions that will shape the future of her field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee also recognized Kara’s work to create “a stimulating and productive multigenerational research group. Her mentorship is thoughtful and intentional, guiding and supporting each student or postdoc while giving them the freedom to grow and become self-reliant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the nomination process, students praised Kara’s teaching skills, enthusiasm, organization, friendly demeanor, and knowledge of the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Erin is the best faculty mentor I have ever had,” says one of her students. “She is supportive, engaged, and able to provide detailed input on projects when needed, but also gives the right amount of freedom to her students/postdocs to aid in their development. Working with Erin has been one of the best parts of my time at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kara received a BA in physics from Barnard College, and an MPhil in physics and a PhD in astronomy from the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University. She subsequently served as Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow and then Neil Gehrels Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Maryland and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. She joined the MIT faculty in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her recognitions include the American Astronomical Society‘s Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, for “outstanding achievement, over the past five years, in observational astronomical research,” and the Rossi Prize from the High-Energy Astrophysics Division of the AAS (shared).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The award committee lauded Kara’s service in the field and at MIT, including her participation with the Physics Graduate Admissions Committee, the Pappalardo Postdoctoral Fellowship Committee, and the MKI Anti-Racism Task Force. Professor Kara also participates in dinners and meet-and-greets invited by student groups, such as Undergraduate Women in Physics, Graduate Women in Physics, and the Society of Physics Students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her participation in public outreach programs includes her talks “Black Hole Echoes and the Music of the Cosmos” at both the Concord Conservatory of Music and an event with MIT School of Science alumni, and “What’s for dinner? How black holes eat nearby stars” for the MIT Summer Research Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is nothing more gratifying than being recognized by your peers, and I am so appreciative and touched that my colleagues in physics even thought to nominate me for this award,” says Kara. “I also want to express my gratitude to my awesome research group. They are what makes this job so fun and so rewarding, and I know I wouldn’t be in this position without their hard work, great attitudes, and unwavering curiosity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>MIT community members gather on campus to witness 93 percent totality</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-community-members-gather-for-partial-eclipse-0408</link>

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The stars and other celestial objects truly aligned on MIT’s campus Monday. After a weekend of rain, the community was treated to clear skies and high temperatures to view the only partial eclipse for the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community members took in the interstellar anomaly in gatherings large and small. Although many traveled north to view the full eclipse, those in Greater Boston were treated with 93 percent coverage and ample ways to appreciate the cosmic wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the moon met the sun beginning around 2:15 p.m., Kresge Oval hosted crowds of onlookers, with staff members handing out solar filters of various types and encouraging star-struck viewers to sketch what they saw and tell stories. The event was hosted by the MT Edgerton Center and inspired by the seminar &lt;a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mECa.html#EC.050" target="_blank"&gt;EC.050/090&lt;/a&gt; (Recreate Experiments from History: Inform the Future with the Past).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A view of the eclipse through eclipse glasses" data-align="center" data-caption="&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Shown here is a photo of the April 8, 2024 eclipse, taken through a pair of eclipse glasses.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of campus, the MIT Museum also hosted a gathering that included a full afternoon of programming. Attendees could hear from an astronomer and ask questions while they took in the views with solar filter glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Building 55, home to the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), where the lives of stars take up a bit more headspace each day, sights and sounds from NASA’s livestream appeared on the department’s large new media wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the gatherings could have been a scene out of a science fiction movie as everyone donned their glasses and looked up in amazement at the darkening sky. Those with extra eyewear to share quickly found themselves with new friends to experience the moment with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Edgerton Center is really about building communities, and this was an opportunity to get the MIT community together to observe this thing that rarely happens and have some conversations about what's really going on,” said Jim Bales, the associate director of the Edgerton Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such events have evoked fear and confusion in Earthlings throughout history, but this time, MIT’s community members seemed more prone to appreciative reflection. Many students, faculty, and staff took a break from terrestrial life to take in the rare natural phenomena, a welcome planetary disruption to an otherwise typical Monday on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A huge crowd at the Lincoln Laboratory poses for group photo, hands up in there." data-align="center" data-caption="&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;A huge crowd at the Lincoln Laboratory poses for group photo.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Watch parties are cool because you’re learning from what other people have to say about it and you get to meet new people,” said sophomore Sol Roberts. “You can only stare up for so long, but being with other people it makes it more enjoyable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, MIT didn’t abandon its scientific bent entirely. The community, after all, was never going to stop helping humanity understand the fundamental workings of the universe. Myriad community members participated in professional and citizen science initiatives of one sort of another. Meanwhile, MIT’s Haystack Observatory in Westford, Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-haystack-scientists-observe-solar-eclipses-effects-0404" target="_blank"&gt;measured changes&lt;/a&gt; in the atmosphere, and members of the Department of Physics took measurements of the sun’s intensity using the shiny new radio telescope on the roof of Building 54.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As surreal as the skies appeared, the Earth’s surface offered equally fun sights. The gatherings made the eclipse at once an intergalactic event and a hyper-local one, an impossibly distant astronomical anomaly shared between friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="A group of MIT members, including President Sally Kornbluth look up at the eclipse from a balcony." data-align="center" data-caption="&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;MIT administrators including Sally Kornbluth (holding brown bag) pause a meeting to enjoy the eclipse.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On April 8, the moon’s shadow will sweep through North America, trailing a diagonal ribbon of momentary, midday darkness across parts of the continent. Those who happen to be within the “path of totality” will experience a total solar eclipse — a few eerie minutes when the sun, moon, and Earth align, such that the moon perfectly blocks out the sun. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last solar eclipse to pass over the continental United States occurred in August 2017, when the moon’s shadow swept from Oregon down to South Carolina. This time, the moon will be closer to the Earth and will track a wider ribbon, from Mexico through Texas and on up into Maine and eastern Canada. The shadow will move across more populated regions than in 2017, and will completely block the sun for more than 31 million people who live in its path. The eclipse will also partly shade many more regions, giving much of the country a partial eclipse, depending on the local weather. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While many of us ready our eclipse-grade eyewear, scientists at MIT’s Haystack Observatory are preparing a constellation of instruments to study the eclipse and how it will affect the topmost layers of the atmosphere. In particular, they will be focused on the ionosphere — the atmosphere’s outermost layer where many satellites orbit. The ionosphere stretches from 50 to 400 miles above the Earth’s surface and is continually blasted by the sun’s extreme ultraviolet and X-ray radiation. This daily solar exposure ionizes gas molecules in the atmosphere, creating a charged sea of electrons and ions that shifts with changes in the sun’s energy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-haystack-observatory-investigates-space-weather-effects-solar-eclipse-0817" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As they did in 2017&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Haystack researchers will study how the ionosphere responds before, during, and after the eclipse, as the sun’s radiation suddenly dips. With this year’s event, the scientists will be adding two new technologies to the mix, giving them a first opportunity to observe the eclipse’s effects at local, regional, and national scales. What they observe will help scientists better understand how the atmosphere reacts to other sudden changes in solar radiation, such as solar storms and flares. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two lead members of Haystack’s eclipse effort are research scientists Larisa Goncharenko, who studies the physics of the ionosphere using measurements from multiple observational sources, and John Swoboda, who develops instruments to observe near-Earth space phenomena. While preparing for eclipse day, Goncharenko and Swoboda took a break to chat with &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; about the ways in which they will be watching the event and what they hope to learn from Monday’s rare planetary alignment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s a lot of excitement around this solar eclipse. Before we dive into how you’ll be observing it, let’s take a step back to talk about what we know so far: How does a total eclipse affect the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goncharenko&lt;/strong&gt;: We know quite a bit. One of the largest effects is, as the moon’s shadow moves over part of the continent, we have a significant decrease in electron, or plasma, density in the ionosphere. The sun is an ionization source, and as soon as that source is removed, we have a decrease in electron density. So, we sort of have a hole in the ionosphere that moves behind the moon’s shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During an eclipse, solar heating shuts off and it’s like a rapid sunset and sunrise, and we have significant cooling in the atmosphere. So, we have this cold area of low ionization, moving in latitude and longitude. And because of this change in temperature, you also have disturbances in the wind system that affect how plasma, or electrons in the ionosphere, are distributed. And these are changes on large scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this cold area that follows totality, we also have different kinds of waves emanating. Like a boat moving on the water, you have bow shock waves moving from the shadow. These are waves in electron density. They are small perturbations but can cover really large areas. &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/solar-eclipse-caused-bow-waves-earths-atmosphere-0119" target="_blank"&gt;We saw similar waves&lt;/a&gt; in the 2017 eclipse. But every eclipse is different. So, we will be using this eclipse as a unique lab experiment. And we will be able to see changes in electron density, temperature, and winds in the upper atmosphere as the eclipse moves over the continental United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How will you be seeing all this? What experiments will you be running to catch the eclipse and its effects on the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swoboda:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re going to measure local changes in the atmosphere and ionosphere using &lt;a href="https://www.haystack.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EMVSIS_eclipse_background.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;two new radar technologies&lt;/a&gt;. The first is Zephyr, which was developed by [Haystack research scientist] Ryan Volz. Zephyr looks at how meteors break up in our atmosphere. There are always little bits of sand that burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere, and when they burn up, they leave a trail of plasma that follows the wind patterns in the upper atmosphere. Zephyr sends out a signal that bounces off these plasma trails, so we can see how they are carried by winds moving at very high altitude. We will use Zephyr to observe how these winds in the upper atmosphere change during the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other radar system is EMVSIS [Electro-Magnetic Vector Sensor Ionospheric Sounder], which will measure the electron or plasma density and the bulk velocity of the charged particles in the ionosphere. Both these systems comprise a distributed array of transmitters and receivers that send and receive radio waves at various frequencies to do their measurements. Traditional ionospheric sounders require high-power transmitters and large towers on the order of hundreds of feet, and can cover an area the size of a football field. But we’ve developed a lower-power and physically smaller system, about the size of a refrigerator, and we’re deploying multiple of these systems around New England to make local and regional measurements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goncharenko: &lt;/strong&gt;We will also make regional observations with two antennas at the Millstone Hill Geospace Facility [in Westford, Massachusetts]. One antenna is a fixed vertical antenna, 220 feet in diameter, that we can use to observe parameters in the ionosphere over a huge range of altitudes, from 90 to 1,000 kilometers above the ground. The other is a steerable antenna that’s 150 feet in diameter, which we can move to look what happens as far away as Florida and all the way to the central United States. We are planning to use both antennas to see changes during the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be processing data from a national network of almost 3,000 GNSS &lt;strong&gt;[Global Navigation Satellite System] &lt;/strong&gt;receivers across the United States, and we’re installing new receivers in undersampled regions along the area of totality. These receivers will measure how the ionosphere’s electron content changes before, during, and after the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things is, this is the first time we’ll have all four of these technologies working together. Each of these technologies provides a unique point of view. And for me as a scientist, I feel like a little kid on Christmas Eve. You know great things are coming, and you know you’ll have new things to play with and new data to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;And speaking of what you’ll find, what do you expect to see from the measurements you collect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goncharenko&lt;/strong&gt;: I expect to see the unexpected. It will be first time for us to look at the near-Earth space with a combination of four very different technologies at the same time and in the same geographic region. We expect higher sensitivity that translates into better resolution in time and space. Probing the upper atmosphere with a combination of these diagnostic tools will provide simultaneous observations we never had before &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; four-dimensional wind flow, electron density, ion temperature, plasma motion. We will observe how they change during the eclipse and study how and why changes in one area of the upper atmosphere are linked to perturbations in other areas in space and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swoboda&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re also sort of thinking longer term. What the eclipse is giving us is a chance to show what these technologies can do, and say, what if we could have these going all the time? We could run it as a sort of radar network for space weather, like how we monitor weather in the lower atmosphere. And we need to monitor space weather, because we have so much going on in the near-Earth space environment, with satellites launching all the time that are affected by space weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goncharenko&lt;/strong&gt;: We have a lot of space to study. The eclipse is just the highlight. But overall, these systems can produce more data to get a look at what happens in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere during other disturbances, such as storms and lightning periods, or coronal mass ejections and solar flares. And all of this is part of a large effort to build up our understanding of near-Earth space to meet demands of modern technological society.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Monday, April 8, the United States will experience a total solar eclipse — a rare astronomical event where the moon passes directly between the sun and the Earth, blocking out the sun’s light almost completely. The last total solar eclipse in the contiguous U.S. was in 2017, and the next one won’t be until 2044.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the weather cooperates, people across the United States — from northeastern Maine to southwestern Texas — will be able to observe the eclipse using protective eyewear. Those in the &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/"&gt;path of totality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;where the moon entirely covers the sun, will have the best view, but 99% of people in the continental U.S. will be able to see a partial eclipse. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather permitting, those on the MIT campus and the surrounding area will see 93 percent of the sun covered, with the partial eclipse starting at 2:15 p.m. and reaching its peak around 3:29 p.m. Gatherings are planned at the &lt;a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/watch-the-moon-bite-the-suns-disk" target="_blank"&gt;Kresge Oval&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/2024-solar-eclipse" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Museum&lt;/a&gt;, and a live NASA stream &lt;a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/nasa-eclipse-broadcast-viewing-with-eaps" target="_blank"&gt;will be shown in the Building 55 atrium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/aeroastro/fellows_staff/brian-mernoff/"&gt;Brian Mernoff&lt;/a&gt;, manager of the CommLab in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, is an accomplished astrophotographer and science educator. Mernoff is headed to Vermont with his family to experience the totality from the best possible angle — but has offered a few thoughts on how to enjoy the eclipse safely, wherever you are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What should viewers expect to see and experience with this solar eclipse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;When you’re watching TV (the sun) and your toddler, dog, or other large mammal (the moon) blocks your view, you no doubt move over a bit to try to get a partial or full view of the TV. This is exactly how the path of totality works for an eclipse. If you are exactly in line with the moon and sun, it will be completely blocked, but if you start moving away from this path, your view of the sun will start to increase until the moon is not in the way at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closer you are to the path of totality, the more of the sun will be blocked. At MIT, about 93 percent of the sun will be blocked. Those in the area will notice that things around you will get slightly darker, just like when it starts to become overcast. Even so, the sun will remain very bright in the sky and solar glasses will be required to view the entirety of the eclipse. It really goes to show how incredibly bright the sun is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the narrow path of totality, the moon will continue to move across the sun, reaching 100 percent coverage. For this short period of time, you can remove your glasses and see a black disk where the sun should be. Around the disk will be wispy white lines. This is the corona, the outermost part of the sun, which is normally outshone by the sun’s photosphere (surface). Around the edges of the black disk of the moon, right as totality begins and ends, you can also see bright spots around the edges, known as Bailey’s Beads, caused by sunlight shining between mountains and craters on the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all! Although you will be tempted to stare up at the sun throughout totality, do not forget to observe the world around you. During totality, it feels like twilight. There is a 360-degree sunset, the temperature changes rapidly, winds change, animals start making different sounds, and shadows start getting weird (look into “shadow bands” if you have a chance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as totality ends, and you start to see Baily’s Beads again, put your solar glasses back on as it will get very bright again very fast as the moon moves out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are the best options for viewing the eclipse safely and to greatest effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;No matter where you are during the eclipse, make sure you have solar glasses. These glasses should be ISO-approved for solar viewing. Do not use glasses with scratches, holes, or other damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to obtain solar glasses in time, you can safely view the eclipse using a &lt;a href="https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/projection"&gt;home-made projection method&lt;/a&gt;, such as a pinhole &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; or even projecting the image of the sun through a colander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best view of the eclipse will be from within the path of totality, but even if you are not within it, you should still go outside to experience the partial eclipse. Use the &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/"&gt;NASA Eclipse Explorer&lt;/a&gt; to find the start, maximum, and end times, and then find a nice spot outside — preferably with some shade — put on your glasses, and enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a closer view of the sun, find a friend that has a telescope with the correct ISO-certified solar filter. This will let you see the photosphere (or chromosphere if it is an H-alpha scope) in a lot more detail. If you do not have access to a telescope, NASA plans to &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/live/"&gt;livestream a telescope view&lt;/a&gt; throughout the eclipse. [The livestream will be displayed publicly on a large screen in Building 55 at MIT, rain or shine.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only time you can look at or image the sun without a filter is during 100 percent totality. As soon as this period is done, glasses and filters must be put back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the eclipse, keep your glasses and filters. You can use them to look at the sun on any day (it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize that I could use the glasses at any time instead of lugging out a telescope). On a really clear day, you can sometimes see sunspots!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How does eclipse photography work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;This year I plan to photograph the eclipse in two ways. The first is using a hydrogen-alpha telescope. This telescope filters out all light except for one wavelength that is given off by hydrogen. Because it blocks out most of the light from the sun’s surface, it allows you to see the turbulent upper atmosphere of the sun, including solar prominences that follow magnetic field lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this telescope does not allow for imaging during totality as too much light is blocked, I also plan to set up a regular camera with a wide-angle lens to capture the total eclipse with the surrounding environment as context. During the 2017 eclipse, I only captured close-ups of the sun using a regular solar filter and missed the opportunity to capture what was going on around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will it work? That depends on if we get clear skies, and how many pictures of my 1.5-year-old need to be taken (as well as how much chasing needs to be done).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to take pictures of the eclipse, make sure you protect your camera sensor. The sun can easily damage lenses, sensors, and other components. Here are &lt;a href="https://www.lensrentals.com/blog/2017/09/rental-camera-gear-destroyed-by-the-solar-eclipse-of-2017/#:~:text=Lens%20Iris%20Damage,simpler%20terms%2C%20the%20aperture%20adjustment." target="_blank"&gt;some examples of solar damaged cameras&lt;/a&gt;. The solution is simple, though. If using a camera phone, you can take pictures through an extra pair of solar glasses, or even tape them to the phone. For cameras with larger lenses, you can buy cardboard filters that slide over the front of your camera or even buy ISO-approved solar film and make your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Any fun, unique, cool, or interesting science facts about this eclipse to share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;If you want to get even more involved with the eclipse, there are many &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/eclipse-2024-citizen-science/"&gt;citizen science projects&lt;/a&gt; that plan to collect as much data as possible throughout the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NASA is planning to run several &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/eclipse-2024-science/"&gt;experiments during the eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers with MIT Haystack Observatory will also be using four different technologies to &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-haystack-scientists-observe-solar-eclipses-effects-0404"&gt;monitor changes in the upper atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, both locally and across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more about the eclipse, here are two of my favorite videos, one on “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUMxNfDfFY" target="_blank"&gt;unexpected science from a 0.000001 megapixel home-made telescope&lt;/a&gt;” and one on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wZKAoUeGRw" target="_blank"&gt;solar eclipse preparation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Persistent “hiccups” in a far-off galaxy draw astronomers to new black hole behavior</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the heart of a far-off galaxy, a supermassive black hole appears to have had a case of the hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astronomers from MIT, Italy, the Czech Republic, and elsewhere have found that a previously quiet black hole, which sits at the center of a galaxy about 800 million light-years away, has suddenly erupted, giving off plumes of gas every 8.5 days before settling back to its normal, quiet state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The periodic hiccups are a new behavior that has not been observed in black holes until now. The scientists believe the most likely explanation for the outbursts stems from a second, smaller black hole that is zinging around the central, supermassive black hole and slinging material out from the larger black hole’s disk of gas every 8.5 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, which are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj8898" target="_blank"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, challenge the conventional picture of black hole accretion disks, which scientists had assumed are relatively uniform disks of gas that rotate around a central black hole. The new results suggest that accretion disks may be more varied in their contents, possibly containing other black holes and even entire stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/black-hole-plumes.gif" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="08cb1f69-0063-4eb0-8bcc-31e8977e9a92" data-entity-type="file" alt="Animation of small circle orbiting another circle in center of lenses opening.

The telescopes automatically survey the entire sky once a day for signs of supernovae and other transient phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December of 2020, the survey spotted a burst of light in a galaxy about 800 million light years away. That particular part of the sky had been relatively quiet and dark until the telescopes’ detection, when the galaxy suddenly brightened by a factor of 1,000. Pasham, who happened to see the detection reported in a community alert, chose to focus in on the flare with NASA’s NICER (the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer), an X-ray telescope aboard the International Space Station that continuously monitors the sky for X-ray bursts that could signal activity from neutron stars, black holes, and other extreme gravitational phenomena. The timing was fortuitous, as it was getting toward the end of the yearlong period during which Pasham had permission to point, or “trigger,” the telescope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was either use it or lose it, and it turned out to be my luckiest break,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He trained NICER to observe the far-off galaxy as it continued to flare. The outburst lasted about four months before petering out. During that time, NICER took measurements of the galaxy’s X-ray emissions on a daily, high-cadence basis. When Pasham looked closely at the data, he noticed a curious pattern within the four-month flare: subtle dips, in a very narrow band of X-rays, that seemed to reappear every 8.5 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed that the galaxy’s burst of energy periodically dipped every 8.5 days. The signal is similar to what astronomers see when an orbiting planet crosses in front of its host star, briefly blocking the star’s light. But no star would be able to block a flare from an entire galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was scratching my head as to what this means because this pattern doesn’t fit anything that we know about these systems,” Pasham recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punch it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he was looking for an explanation to the periodic dips, Pasham came across a recent paper by theoretical physicists in the Czech Republic. The theorists had separately worked out that it would be possible, in theory, for a galaxy’s central supermassive black hole to host a second, much smaller black hole. That smaller black hole could orbit at an angle from its larger companion’s accretion disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the theorists proposed, the secondary would periodically punch through the primary black hole’s disk as it orbits. In the process, it would release a plume of gas, like a bee flying through a cloud of pollen. Powerful magnetic fields, to the north and south of the black hole, could then slingshot the plume up and out of the disk. Each time the smaller black hole punches through the disk, it would eject another plume, in a regular, periodic pattern. If that plume happened to point in the direction of an observing telescope, it might observe the plume as a dip in the galaxy’s overall energy, briefly blocking the disk’s light every so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was super excited by this theory, and I immediately emailed them to say, ‘I think we’re observing exactly what your theory predicted,’” Pasham says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and the Czech scientists teamed up to test the idea, with simulations that incorporated NICER’s observations of the original outburst, and the regular, 8.5-day dips. What they found supports the theory: The observed outburst was likely a signal of a second, smaller black hole, orbiting a central supermassive black hole, and periodically puncturing its disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team found that the galaxy was relatively quiet prior to the December 2020 detection. The team estimates the galaxy’s central supermassive black hole is as massive as 50 million suns. Prior to the outburst, the black hole may have had a faint, diffuse accretion disk rotating around it, as a second, smaller black hole, measuring 100 to 10,000 solar masses, was orbiting in relative obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that, in December 2020, a third object — likely a nearby star — swung too close to the system and was shredded to pieces by the supermassive black hole’s immense gravity — an event that astronomers know as a “tidal disruption event.” The sudden influx of stellar material momentarily brightened the black hole’s accretion disk as the star’s debris swirled into the black hole. Over four months, the black hole feasted on the stellar debris as the second black hole continued orbiting. As it punched through the disk, it ejected a much larger plume than it normally would, which happened to eject straight out toward NICER’s scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out numerous simulations to test the periodic dips. The most likely explanation, they conclude, is a new kind of David-and-Goliath system — a tiny, intermediate-mass black hole, zipping around a supermassive black hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a different beast,” Pasham says. “It doesn’t fit anything that we know about these systems. We’re seeing evidence of objects going in and through the disk, at different angles, which challenges the traditional picture of a simple gaseous disk around black holes. We think there is a huge population of these systems out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a brilliant example of how to use the debris from a disrupted star to illuminate the interior of a galactic nucleus which would otherwise remain dark.&amp;nbsp;It is akin to using fluorescent dye to find a leak in a pipe,” says Richard Saxton, an X-ray astronomer from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) in Madrid, who was not involved in the study. “This result shows that very close super-massive black hole binaries&amp;nbsp;could be common in galactic nuclei, which is a very exciting development for future gravitational wave detectors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
